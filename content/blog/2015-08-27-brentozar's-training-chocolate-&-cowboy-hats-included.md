title: 'Brentozar''s Training: Chocolate & Cowboy Hats Included'
---

It was entertaining to listen to a technical wizard fighting the obsession with waiting to eat chocolate with 3k viewers watching. Kendra wore about 4-5 cowboy hats in an effort to help those of us who wear many hats feel welcome.... Now that's the kinda of training I enjoy! No pretense, just honest real, and insightful training with enjoyable humor included for free

**Highly recommend attending the webex presentations occurring today and tomorrow with Brent Ozar and his amazing team.** They are giving back to the community with some excellent training and Q&A. Attended the Shared Storage discussion yesterday and wasn't disappointed (I don't think they've ever disappointed with their training!)
Register for the training now, as it is the second of the 3 days, with the first training occurring here @ 10am CST.
