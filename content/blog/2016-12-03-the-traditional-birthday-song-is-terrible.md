title: The Traditional Birthday Song Is Terrible
---

The traditional birthday song is terrible.It's never really changed.
It's like singing a dirge.
It's really really hard for people to sing anywhere close to on key.
We all sing it because we have to, but there is this feeling of regret, like "I'll do it for you, but just because I love you".
It is followed by "Many mourns" by the closest available family clown.
Apparently, the roots were back in the 19th century, and wikipedia says:

> In 1988, Warner/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for US$25 million, with the value of "Happy Birthday" estimated at US$5 million....In February 2016 Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, paving the way for the song to become public domain.[18] [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You)
> Let's leave this tainted legacy behind. I propose a radical change.
> Ditch it for something fun. Make a new family tradition.

This is much more like Rend Collective's reminder to be always practicing the Art of Celebration :-) It's super easy to sing the first time, promotes foot stomping and hand clapping, promotes dancing and jumping, and overall, I feel conveys the feeling a birthday should have.
New lyrics:

    **The Art of Celebration Birthday Song**
    - created after much deliberation and refinement in 1 min at the house of Sheldon Hull
    Hey hey hey, It's your birthday day
    Hey hey hey, It's your birthday day
    Hey hey hey, It's your birthday day
    Sing Loud, Sing Proud, It's Your Birthday
