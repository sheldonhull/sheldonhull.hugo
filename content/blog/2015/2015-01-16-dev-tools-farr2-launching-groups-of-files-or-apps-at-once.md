There are probably a common number of apps you pull up when you pull up your system. For example, I pull up my Trello board, outlook, XYplorer, Sublime text 3, Sql server management studio, and ketarin (app updater). Found that you can easily setup a simply alias and launch a group of apps or files at anytime by simply typing the keyword.

This could easily launch a favorite group of files by adding to your startup or project list as you go. The right click on search results gives you this option on the fly.
