## Examples Where Copilot Failed

## Examples Where Copilot Has Been Amazing

??? example "ASCII color codes in bash scripts"

    This has always messed with me, and I spend more time trying to find the pattern of "background is blue with white text and bold" to add a little bit of polish.
    Copilot nailed this with a comment in a `.envrc` file stating: `# variable for setting terminal output with light yellow background and black text that is bold` resulting in a perfect match.
