This is primarily focused on folks who don't use Go tooling everday, but want to use Go tools.
Maybe you need help getting up and running?

## Go Binaries

Tools that can compile to a Go binary such as CLI tools or a web server can be installed from source easily, by running `go install`.

There's a few things you need though to do this.

- Go installed üòÄ
  - Using aqua makes this easy.
- The path the binaries are dropped into isn't in your `PATH` by default, so you need to ensure your shell of choice has this path added so the binaries can be found globally.
  - Ensure binaries can be found. `export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}"`
- The right way to invoke it.

## Setup Path Variables So Go Tooling Can Be Found

=== "linux/darwin"

    ```shell title="linux (.zshenv, .bashrc, etc)"
    # If using private, then you can set something like this: export GOPRIVATE=dev.azure.com
    export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
    export GOBIN="${HOME}/go/bin"
    export PATH="${GOBIN}:${PATH}"
    ```

=== "windows"

    ```pwsh title="windows"
      if ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition -ne 'Core') {
        Write-Warning "Please use PowerShell Core 7+ for this to work"
        return
      }
      # If using private, then you can set something like this: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GOPRIVATE', 'dev.azure.com', 'Machine')
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GOPATH', (Join-Path $Home 'go'), 'Machine')
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GOBIN', (Join-Path $Home 'go' 'bin'), 'Machine')
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', ((Join-Path $Home 'go' 'bin'), $ENV:PATH -join [IO.Path]::PathSeparator), 'Machine')
      New-Item -Path (Join-Path $Home 'go') -ItemType Directory -Force -EA 0
      Write-Host "Shutdown Terminal and reopen for this to take effect üôè" -ForegroundColor Green
    ```
