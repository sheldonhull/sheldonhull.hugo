## Starter Template

I saved this as a snippet for vscode to get up and running quickly with something better than the defaults for handling `func main` isolation. I've been working on modifying this a bit as I don't really like using args, but am trying not to overcomplicate things as a new gopher.

I tend to like better flag parsing than using args, but it's still a better pattern to get functions isolated from main to easily test.

The gist that I've taken from this and discussions in the community is ensure that `main` is where program termination is dedicated instead of handling this in your functions. This isolation of logic from main ensures you can more easily setup your tests as well, since `func main()` isn't testable.

```go
package main

// package template from:
import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "os"
)

const (
    // exitFail is the exit code if the program
    // fails.
    exitFail = 1
)

func main() {
    if err := run(os.Args, os.Stdout); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
        os.Exit(exitFail)
    }
}

func run(args []string, stdout io.Writer) error {
    if len(args) == 0 {
        return errors.New("no arguments")
    }
    for _, value := range args[1:] {
        fmt.Fprintf(stdout, "Running %s", value)
    }
    return nil
}
```
