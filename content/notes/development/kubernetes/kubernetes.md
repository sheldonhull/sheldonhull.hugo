## Deployment Tips

- What imagePullPolicy should I use?
  > The caching semantics of the underlying image provider make even imagePullPolicy: Always efficient, as long as the registry is reliably accessible.[image-policy]

## Troubleshooting

??? note "Error: ImagePullBackOff"

    Thanks to a [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64003061/68698) I was pointed to the answer on [pre-pulled-images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#pre-pulled-images).

    This is a great example of the challenges of abstraction with tools.
    The declared image policies have more impact on the behavior than I originally thought.

    > By default, the kubelet tries to pull each image from the specified registry. However, if the imagePullPolicy property of the container is set to IfNotPresent or Never, then a local image is used (preferentially or exclusively, respectively).

    To load an image you can run a command like this: `minikube image load --profile myprofile 'image:latest'`.
