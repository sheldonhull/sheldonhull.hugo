[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) was announced today. I've been a believer in this for a while now, and have been on the early access testing of online.visualstudio.com. Apparently it's renamed to Visual Studio Codespaces now, and is the same tech. Will be a while before this trickles out to be mainstream, but as an early adopter of "developer workspaces as code" it's an exciting time. 

The fact that I can now spin up with a couple text files a full development test environment, with SQL Server in Docker, a configured development environment with linting and more, and then rebuild this in a few minutes on any machine is pretty incredible.
