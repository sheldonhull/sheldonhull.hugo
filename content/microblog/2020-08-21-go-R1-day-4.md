## Day 4 of 100

## progress

- In the last week some more Pluralsight Go (Nigel's courses are always stellar)
- I've done some odd work as had time in between last update, but nothing structured. Might continue with `learn-go-with-tests` but also came across [exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/go) and might tackle that soon as well.
- Setup new project in Visual Studio Codespaces
- Used Serverless Framework to generate `aws-go` template project
- Imported `aws-go-sdk` resources for AWS SSM Secrets Manager
- Grabbed SSM Secrets manager output and used to create a POST request for authorization token
- Used DumpRequest to pretty print output for debugging purpose
- Hung my head in shame at my copy pasta project ðŸ˜€
- Realized half of the battle is just getting my lambda debugging effort running locally. Not exactly the easiest starter project.
- Need to master different request types. PowerShell makes this easy with Invoke-RestMethod and object construction. I found that the `Post` method wasn't appropriate as I wanted to control custom headers. This required me to use a different approach, which I ended up doing with `http.Client{}`.
- Not sure in a Go Playground sample to test and echo a post request. Thinking if no service that does this might try creating a Go routine to accept the request locally and echo for the purpose of a demo. Any suggestions welcome.
