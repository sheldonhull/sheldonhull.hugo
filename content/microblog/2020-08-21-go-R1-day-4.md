## Day 4 of 100

## progress

- In the last week some more Pluralsight Go (Nigel's courses are always stellar)
- I've done some odd work as had time in between last update, but nothing structured. Might continue with `learn-go-with-tests` but also came across [exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/go) and might tackle that soon as well.
- Setup new project in Visual Studio Codespaces
- Used Serverless Framework to generate `aws-go` template project
- Imported `aws-go-sdk` resources for AWS SSM Secrets Manager
- Grabbed SSM Secrets manager output and used to create a POST request for authorization token
- Used DumpRequest to pretty print output for debugging purpose
- Hung my head in shame at my copy pasta project üòÄ
- Realized half of the battle is just getting my lambda debugging effort running locally. Not exactly the easiest starter project.
- Need to master different request types. PowerShell makes this easy with Invoke-RestMethod and object construction. I found that the `Post` method wasn't appropriate as I wanted to control custom headers. This required me to use a different approach, which I ended up doing with `http.Client{}`.
- Not sure in a Go Playground sample to test and echo a post request. Thinking if no service that does this might try creating a Go routine to accept the request locally and echo for the purpose of a demo. Any suggestions welcome.
- Identified i really need better understanding of the godoc libraries as would help a lot. Vscode intellisense even in codespaces isn't performing great, so I'm not getting that help that would really expedite discovery as a beginner. I might give my EAP Goland install a try and see if it helps.
- Successfully included `zap` logging library
- Successfully submitted request for authorization token and got response back into a struct, something that as a newbie I found a major win üéâ using `json.Unmarshal([]byte(body), ar)` with `ar` referring to a pointer another win for me as new to pointers) being passed in like below:

```go
// AuthResponse the authorization object returned by taco service when doing fancy things
type AuthResponse struct {
	MagicalToken string `json:"magical_token"`
	ExpiresIn    int    `json:"expires_in"`
}

func main() {
	var ar AuthResponse
	getToken(&ar) // pointer for the win ‚ö°Ô∏è
}
func getToken(ar *AuthResponse) {
	json.Unmarshal([]byte(body), ar) // ‚ùì using bytes for json is new to me. gotta learn more
	sugar.Infow("Logging library with zap used to generate structured logs",
	"authResponse", ar,  // trailing quotes is the norm, also a new pattern for me
)
}
```
