It's really hard to prioritize when life gets busy, but it's important that continued improvement is a priority.

[Great at Work: How Top Performers Do Less, Work Better, and Achieve More](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Performers-Less-Achieve/dp/1501179519) was a really interesting book.
The fact that small incremental improvement done daily can make such a difference is pretty interesting.

It's similar to Agile tenenets in how to approach software design.
Smaller iterations with rapid feedback is better than large isolated batches work delivered without regular feedback.
