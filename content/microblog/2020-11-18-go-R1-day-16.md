## Day 16 of 100

## progress

- refactored AWS SDK call to export a named file using flags.
- Iterated through regions so cli call aggregated all results from all regions into single JSON.
- Working with v1 makes me want v2 so much more.
The level of pointers required is ridiculous.
At one point I had something like `&*ec2` due to the SDK requirements.
Having to write a filter with: `Filters: { Name: aws.String("foo")}` is so clunky.
I believe in v2 this is greatly simplified, and the code is much cleaner.
