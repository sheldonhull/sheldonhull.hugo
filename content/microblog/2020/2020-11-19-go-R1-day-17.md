## Day 17 of 100

## progress

- reviewed adding excel conversion to cli
- shelved this after reviewing implementation requirements
- this is one of those cases where PowerShell makes much more sense for adhoc work as converts `pscustomobject` (similar to struct) via pipeline automatically to excel sheet.
