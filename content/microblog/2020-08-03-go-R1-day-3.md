## Day 3 of 100

## progress

- Learned about GOROOT, GOPATH and how to configure
- Ran into problems with Visual Studio code reporting: 

```text
Failed to find the "go" binary in either GOROOT() or PATH(/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin. Check PATH, or Install Go and reload the window.
```
- After attempting solution with various profile files, I tried setting the setting: `"go.goroot": "/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/",` in `settings.json` and this resolved the issue. 
- After it recognized this, I ran the `Go: Current GOPATH` from the command palette and it found it.
- Finally, after this it reporting back some feedback showing it was recognizing the latest version I was running. 
- Initialized a new serverless framework project for `aws-go-mod` template using the following command: `serverless create --template aws-go-mod --path ./sqlserver` and the initial project layout was created.
- I'm sure this will need to be improved as I go along, but since macOS failed on the go path setup, this resolved my problems for now.

```powershell

# GO: Make tools work in console sessions
$ENV:GOPATH = "$ENV:HOME$($ENV:USERPROFILE)/go"

if ($PSVersionTable.OS -match 'Darwin') {
    $ENV:GOROOT = "/usr/local/opt/go/libexec"
    $ENV:PATH += "$ENV:PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
    $ENV:GOBIN = "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
}

```
