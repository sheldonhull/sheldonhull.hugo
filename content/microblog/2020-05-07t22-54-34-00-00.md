Kept getting an error `Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'read'` when running the some updated PowerShell 7 in lambda with the `dotnet3.1` sdk. Was troubleshooting loading types thinking I was having path issues.

Turns out one of these things is not like the other. ðŸ¤£

```sql
set nocount on
set transaction isolation read uncommitted
```

```sql
set nocount on
set transaction isolation level read uncommitted
```

I think this explains why "error during "read".
Maybe I should have run in my Azure Data Studio session before trying serverless ðŸ˜€
