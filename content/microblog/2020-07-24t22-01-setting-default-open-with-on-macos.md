It should be easy to pick a default program to open a file. On macOS, I was surprised at how poor the design was. Seriously, how is this intuitive? `Open With` > ` Set this as default`. Apparently this only set it for an individual file. This means, every different `csv` file required me to do this again.

Instead, I had to `Get Info` > `Unlock settings` and then choose the default `Open With` setting, and further select `Use this application to open all documents like this.`

I enjoy most of my development experience with macOS.

Don't try and tell me that it is the pinnacle of usability though, some of this stuff is just quirky and over complicated. In what world, should my default behavior be set on a specific file and not the the file type?
