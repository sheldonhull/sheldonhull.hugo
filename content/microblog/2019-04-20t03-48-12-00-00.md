> Working smart: how great performers do less work

This book so far is a good read. I like the concept of the "feedback loop", and doing small iterative improvements with a targeted narrow focus to improve each day. It's very much in alignment with Agile concepts. It's kinda like delivery of small measurable bits of value for your own improvement. This contrasts our typical promise to ourselves of radical transformation or resolutions that never get realized. Clarifying these concepts is really helpful to help one be proactive instead of reactive about personal growth.
