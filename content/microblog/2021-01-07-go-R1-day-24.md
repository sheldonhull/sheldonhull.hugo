## Day 23 of 100

## progress

- Used Viper to load configuration for a CLI tool.
- Ran into problems with trying to print out `map[string]interface{}` type.
Lots of magic performed by .NET to do this type of action.
This is a lot more hands-on üòÅ.
- Had stability issues with VSCode today, so I finally switched over to Intellij with the Go plugin and it worked well.
The keyboard mappings are different so that was painful, but still overall a good experience that got me unblocked.
