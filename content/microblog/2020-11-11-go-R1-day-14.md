## Day 14 of 100

## progress

- Migrated my new aws lambda logger from zap to zerolog. Zap gave me some problems initially so zerolog is my favorite structured logger right now, much simpler.
- Constructed `go-task` runner file for launching go test and go build/run.
- Structured logging required a little bit of refactor but worked.

Here's an example of providing back a logged string (don't log secrets normally, but I'm in testing phase) with structure.

```go
	log.Debug().
		Str("decodedBinarySecret", decodedBinarySecret).
		Str("secretString", secretString).
		Msg("Depending on whether the secret is a string or binary, one of these fields will be populated.")

```

Based on my improved understanding of conversions vs type assertions, the need to convert using a "cast" (Go calls these conversions, and yes it makes a copy in memory for this):

```go
log.Info().Str("requestDump", string(requestDump)).Msg("request information")
```

Type assertions are done when working with an interface.
I'm still working on my understanding of interfaces as they are their own beast in Go.
Unlike most other languages, a Go type implements an interface when all the required methods are matched.
This provides a great deal of the flexibility in Go interfaces.

The scoping of the interfaces is important, and while I listened to a lecture on this, I didn't yet work through the interface design principles to ensure the best resusability/narrowness of scope concepts.
I think that's going to take more "getting my hands dirty" for it to click.
