Why a brag page?

It's a way to show keep track of some key accomplishments I've achieved, almost like "levels-ups".

While I'm starting this as more like a resume style format, I plan on keeping this updated as I go.

Thanks for stopping by and letting me brag a little!

## What Makes Me Worth Considering?

### What makes a good engineer?

- üíØ Emotional Intelligence & Soft Skills
- A sense of ownership and drive to deliver, from "cradle to grave" mentality.
- Adaptability, willingness to learn and change.
    - I'm a big advocate on continual learning, which hopefully my blog shows!
    - Repeating the same `n` years of experience over and over is something to be avoided.
    - I tend to embrace change and want to continue to improve.

### What I'm a Good Fit For

- Pairing up with strong engineers.
I'm not a fan of lone wolf.
A strong engineering team of "good developers" will out perform the so called "10x" developer and be better for the company both logistically and culturally.
- Generalist experience valued, while allowing for expertise and deeper knowledge.
- Remote-First environments that value asynchronous communication and strong writing abilities.
    - I'm a big fan of Gitlabs Handbook First approach, and have advocated for and done documentation as code, architectural decision records, and other written forms of decision making in most of my career.
- Go! I'm a Gopher, and have been investing in excellence and quality in Go for the last season in my career.
I care about delivery value quickly, while I also care about the "craft" of well-designed and maintainable code.

{{< admonition type="Example" title="How I Tend To Think Through Systems" open=false >}}

Someone might look at deploying a webservice and spin up an EC2 linux webserver and call it done.

What would go through my head:

- Can I host this using a managed service such as ECS Fargate to avoid the operational toil of managing my own instance?
- Can I benefit from a service like this with autoscaling to ensure a failed task can automatically recover or allocate work to a new node?
- Did the web service add the instrumentation libraries for opentracing or the appropriate library?
- Are structured logs being used to ensure automatic parsing by the logging provider?
- Is the service being deployed via a CICD provider instead of manually?
- Are unit tests being run on developer machines with hooks and also by CI system?
- Are integration tests being run prior to deployment?
- Are service level objectives defined and tracked if required to ensure service isn't over-engineered, but also allocated appropriate time for new work if problems occur that would impact customer satisfaction?
- Is the core infrastructure defined via code?
- Is the application configured to pull its configuration from environment variables or cloud configuration provider rather than requiring manual changes?

This was a major effort in migrating content from an outdated large word doc to static generated website with analytics. Load testing, sizing guides, and more were improved. All docs for SQL Server and load test summaries were due to my efforts. CI driven via markdown file updates made this a quick process to keep things up to date. üëç

I'm really glad I'm not working in the mortgage industry & collections oriented roles anymore.

It did teach me to handle high stress situations and do pretty decent at negotation and grow stronger in my communication skills, so there's some positive to that part of the journey! :wink:
