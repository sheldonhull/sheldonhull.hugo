_Why a brag page?_

I'm a big fan of the #LearnInPublic approach, and this page is a way to share a bit more about me than a traditional resume.
It's a bit more personal, and I hope it helps you get a better sense of who I am and what I'm about.

## Recruiter?

If you are recruiter, then this might be useful: [Recruiters]({{< relref "recruiters.md" >}} "recruiters")

## Touching Base

- Add a comment to this page to say hi!
- Or [↗ Ask me Anything](https://github.com/sheldonhull/sheldonhull.hugo/discussions/new?category=ama)
- [Email Me](mailtol:touching.base@mail.sheldonhull.com)

## What Makes Me Worth Considering?

- 💯 Emotional Intelligence & Soft Skills are critical to success.
- As an individual contributor, I understand the importance of influence-based leadership.
- A sense of ownership and drive to deliver, from "cradle to grave" mentality.
- Adaptability, willingness to learn and change.
  - Repeating the same `n` years of experience over and over is something to be avoided.
  - I'm on the right side of the scale when it comes to embracing change and continual iteration to improve.

### What Environment I'm A Good Fit For

- A culture that:
  - Balances autonomy with collaboration, and shipping frequently while caring about reliability.
  - Assumes the best of it's team members.
- Pairing up with strong engineers, as I'd rather be around folks smarter than me to grow.
I'm not a fan of lone wolf.
A strong engineering team of "good developers" will out perform the so called "10x" developer and be better for the company both logistically and culturally.
- Generalist experience valued, while allowing for expertise and deeper knowledge.
- Remote-First environments that value asynchronous communication and strong writing abilities.
  - I'm a big fan of Gitlabs Handbook First approach, and have advocated for and done documentation as code, architectural decision records, and other written forms of decision making in most of my career.
  - You'll find I'm exceedingly strong at codifying knowledge, which I believe is a priority for effectively scaling knowledge beyond a single person on a team.
- Go! I'm a Gopher, and have been investing in excellence and quality in Go for the last season in my career.
I care about delivery value quickly, while I also care about the "craft" of well-designed and maintainable code.

### What Type Of Work I'm Looking For

- Roles that provide technical challenges beyond basics.
I had a SME focus on database engineering earlier in my career, and moved to a generalist focus.
I'd like to dive deeper into areas such as distributed systems, application scaling & resliency, and automation.
- A role where I can impact and ship.
- Linux as the primary OS for production, not Windows.[^1]

{{< admonition type="Example" title="How I Tend To Think Through Systems" open=false >}}

Someone might look at deploying a webservice and spin up an EC2 linux webserver and call it done.

What would go through my head:

- Can I host this using a managed service such as ECS Fargate to avoid the operational toil of managing my own instance?
- Can I benefit from a service like this with autoscaling to ensure a failed task can automatically recover or allocate work to a new node?
- Did the web service add the instrumentation libraries for opentracing or the appropriate library?
- Are structured logs being used to ensure automatic parsing by the logging provider?
- Is the service being deployed via a CICD provider instead of manually?
- Are unit tests being run on developer machines with hooks and also by CI system?
- Are integration tests being run prior to deployment?
- Are service level objectives defined and tracked if required to ensure service isn't over-engineered, but also allocated appropriate time for new work if problems occur that would impact customer satisfaction?
- Is the core infrastructure defined via code?
- Is the application configured to pull its configuration from environment variables or cloud configuration provider rather than requiring manual changes?

This was a major effort in migrating content from an outdated large word doc to static generated website with analytics. Load testing, sizing guides, and more were improved. All docs for SQL Server and load test summaries were due to my efforts. CI driven via markdown file updates made this a quick process to keep things up to date. 👍

{{< admonition type="info" title="Other Boring Stuff" open=false >}}

In case you are bored, I've done this as well:

{{< fa-icon solid  info-circle >}} Freddie Mac: Loss Mitigation during mortgage crisis<br>
{{< fa-icon solid  info-circle >}} Litton Loan Servicing: Loss Mitigation during mortgage crisis<br>
{{< fa-icon solid  info-circle >}} Greentree Servicing: Mortgage Collections <br>

I'm really glad I'm not working in the mortgage industry & collections oriented roles anymore.

It did teach me to handle high stress situations and do pretty decent at negotation and grow stronger in my communication skills, so there's some positive to that part of the journey! :wink:

### Projects

I'm a big believer in #LearnInPublic approach, and have written for years on my blog on a variety of topics, demonstrating my ability to learn new technology and investment in continued excellence in my craft.
This should help demonstrate my strengths in written communication.

**A few highlights:**

- [Brag - A page with more detail and links than the resume](https://www.sheldonhull.com/brag?ref=bragpage)
- [Go - My Go references docs with tips/templates/practices](https://www.sheldonhull.com/docs/go?ref=bragpage) which I've updated periodically.
- [Go Articles - **A variety of posts (over 104 at time of resume)**](https://www.sheldonhull.com/tags/golang?ref=bragpage)
- [Using Azure DevOps for Private Go Modules - **featured by Azure DevOps Blog**](https://www.sheldonhull.com/using-azure-devops-for-private-go-modules?ref=bragpage)

Open Source Contributions:

While the majority of my work is NDA, I try to contribute when possible upstream as well as publish when possible.

A few projects on GitHub:

- [DelineaXPM](https://github.com/DelineaXPM): I setup the majority of the DevOps Secrets Vault automation, revamped all the public facing repos with Go based automation for testing, development, and templatized CI/CD.
- [sheldonhull - landing page (updated with Github Actions)](https://github.com/sheldonhull)
- [az-pr](https://github.com/sheldonhull/az-pr) for experimentation on a TUI based PR creation tool for Azure DevOps.
- [My blog, documented setup and used as a knowledge base](https://github.com/sheldonhull/sheldonhull.hugo)
- [Magetools - Go based task library for common tasks. I use this instead of Makefiles, as it leverages Mage and the cross-platform power of Go for automation.](https://github.com/sheldonhull/magetools)

I also contribute back to various projects I use when possible: [PR's I've Authored on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=type%3Apr+author%3Asheldonhull&type=Issues)
_As always, any posts on this site are not a reflection of my past or present employer._
