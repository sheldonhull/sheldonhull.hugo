I put this together as a personal accomplishments page to better keep track of things I've accomplished in a more summarized way.

It's really easy to lose track of stuff like this, so I'll try to keep this updated with major wins here.
Initially, it's just kinda a LinkedIn professional profile equivalent, but I'm going to try keep track of some "levelups" and wins here as time goes by.

Thanks for stopping by!
