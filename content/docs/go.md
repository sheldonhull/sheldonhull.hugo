## Starter Template

I saved this as a snippet for vscode to get up and running quickly with something better than the defaults for handling `func main` isolation.
I've been working on modifying this a bit as I don't really like using args, but am trying not to overcomplicate things as a new gopher.

I tend to like better flag parsing than using args, but it's still a better pattern to get functions isolated from main to easily test.

The gist that I've taken from this and discussions in the community is ensure that `main` is where program termination is dedicated instead of handling this in your functions.
This isolation of logic from main ensures you can more easily setup your tests as well, since `func main()` isn't testable.

```go
package main

// package template from:
import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
)

const (
	// exitFail is the exit code if the program
	// fails.
	exitFail = 1
)

func main() {
	if err := run(os.Args, os.Stdout); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
		os.Exit(exitFail)
	}
}

func run(args []string, stdout io.Writer) error {
	if len(args) == 0 {
		return errors.New("no arguments")
	}
	for _, value := range args[1:] {
		fmt.Fprintf(stdout, "Running %s", value)
	}
	return nil
}

```

## Puzzles - FizzBuzz

I honestly had never done any algorithm or interview puzzles beyond sql-server, so I was really happy to knock this out relatively easily.
At least I pass the basic Joel test üòÅ

## Logging

At this stage, I'm using [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) as I found it very easy to get moving with structured logs.

The output of this demo looks pretty good!

Here's a functional demo that can be used to bootstrap a new project with this.
