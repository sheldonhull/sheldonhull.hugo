This is a compilation of what i's more like a "cheatsheet for quick reference and detaileds" than docs.
I like adding snippets and concepts here and there when explaining things to others and for myself so I don't have to relearn those things that just don't click.

Dash and Vscode snippets are great for this as well, but a simple markdown file sometimes is the easiest way to persist something.
