## Hi, I'm Sheldon

Thanks for checking out my page during your busy day.
To ensure I'm on the same page, I've summarized a few roles I'm typically getting recruiters reaching out on, and I tried to summarize the role and what I'd be a good fit for to expedite your assessment.

There is a large difference in expectations for different roles so let me see if I can help make sure I'm a good fit.

## Feedback

The goal of this page was to simplify assessing if I'm a match through all the jargon you have to deal with.

I'd appreciate any feedback on this having been useful, or if it wasn't what I could do to improve it.

## Types of Roles

- Full-Time roles, no contractor to hire.
- Not a consultancy company or managed service provider.
- Start-up is ok, as long as post series a/b since I need a bit of stability.
- Remote First Organization.
    - I'm not willing to relocate.
    - I'll consider Remote-Friendly, if the organization has a solid remote work culture with deliberate efforts to treat remote and local workers equally. (Culture that values writing, async work, and healthy remote communication patterns).
- Technology focused company with a strong-engineering culture.
    - No gambling or mobile gaming companies.
    - No medical/healthcare focused[^med].
    - No banking.[^banking]

[^med]: The rate of change and "redtape" is necessarily very slow in the medical field, making it more difficult to adopt modernized CI/CD (not impossible, but difficult). Looking for a company with more capability to move quickly.
[^banking]: I've done financial/mortgage and that's fine, but right now I'm more focused on technology oriented companies, though I'm willing to consider a financial services company if technology is a core value they offer (like Simple Bank did).

## Target Companies

I assess companies based on the [Pragmatic Engineer Checklist](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-developer-culture-test/)

- Pays at Tier 2-3[^tiers]: Globally competitive rates
    - > "Generous profit-sharing means at least 15-20% of annual salary in good years."
    - Locale adjustment is a negative, but if the compensation is still at a "Tier 3" company, I'll still consider it.
- Engineering organizations that expect a high level of autonomy.
- High talent bar.
- High value placed on continual learning and improvement.
- High value on work-life balance.
- Value placed on contributions back to open source and writing (as I regularly blog and engage open source projects).

## Roles You Might Be Trying to Fill

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Senior Software Engineer" open=false >}}

### Senior Software Engineer

This is the role I'm normally matched against.

This is about as specific as saying "A developer", so it depends on the role.

See Skills section at the bottom if you want to assess if I'm a possible fit.

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Senior Site Reliability Engineer" open=false >}}

### Senior Site Reliability Engineer

**I'd be a good fit for the less common SRE roles that want SRE SWE, aka Site Reliability Engineers with Software Engineering skills[^sreswefocus].**

#### About This Role

The industry has diluted the terminology and in the vast majority of SRE postings, they are looking for a "DevOps Engineer" style role or Systems Administration with a cloud Focus.

> SREs are often generalists, as the desire to learn breadth-first instead of depth-first lends itself well to understanding the bigger picture (and there are few pictures bigger than the intricate inner workings of modern technical infrastructure). These engineers often have strong coding and software development skills, but may not have the traditional SWE experience of being part of a product team or having to think about customer feature requests. [^sreswe]

I'm interested in building & running systems, but want to ensure I'm involved in the entire lifecycle.

[^sreswefocus]: Unlike more traditional system administration operational roles, the SRE SWE solves infrastructure problems with software engineering, coding, building, extending, and doing regular development, but a more platform level. They are not focused purely on operational tasks, but devote at least 50% of the their time towards proactively resolving and improving the reliability of services.

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Senior Systems Engineer" open=false >}}

This can be a great fit if looking for a software engineering role to solve system problems.
This is what AWS titles someone doing a mix of Development and Operational work, expecting a strong software engineer with skills in cloud development & operations.

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Cloud/Platform Engineer" open=false >}}

## Cloud Engineer

This is a role typically focused either on building services with AWS, or a relabled DevOps Engineer

**If Terraform and other infrastructure work is needed as _part_ of the overall development, I'd be a good fit since I have a lot of infrastructure experience and have deep dived into Terraform, used Pulumi, and other infrastructure-as-software style tools.**

I believe in a development team owning the majority of the core stack, including infrastructure for the application.
This would be part of the standard development planning as services were built.

If the role is a relabeled DevOps Engineer, with the primary focus being purely infrastructure automation, then this might not be a good role (see DevOps Engineer section for detail).

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Full Stack Engineer" open=false >}}

### Full Stack Engineer

I'm primarily focused on backend and cloud engineering work, so **this role might not be the right fit.**

I am up for picking up React/Angular as a new hard skill, though I won't have high levels of experience with front-end development on starting the role.

That said, quick hard skill acquisition is the key to a good engineer, so I'm always willing to take on new challenges.

#### About This Role

Some folks have touched front-end through backend code, and are valued in a small team where many hats are worn.

There still tends to be a specialization of frontend or backend, due to the complexity and pace of technology.

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Senior DevOps Engineer" open=false >}}

### Senior DevOps Engineer

**If the role involves a large amount of application or systems development (eg 60%+), and isn't focused on release engineering & CICD automation only, then I might be a good fit.**

Most postings probably are looking for more of a general practice build & release engineer with some operations and this is not the role I'm looking for.

While I have a lot of experience in DevOps practices, and a passion to see them achieved, I'm not looking for a DevOps Engineer role.

I believe in applying these DevOps practices while doing development, and that a dedicated DevOps engineer role is not the right fit.
Often, DevOps Engineer roles aren't held to a higher coding standard as a SWE with a focus on "glue" code doing automation work.

I practice algorithm & code challenges, and want to be working more with technically challenging services over building automation oriented scripts.

In a rare few cases, a DevOps Engineer role is used by HR/Recruiting to find folks with cross-functional soft and hard skills, while still doing active development.

In my experience, that's a unicorn role, that rarely exists though. ðŸ˜€

Example:

- DevOps Engineer: recommend branching strategy to team, or setup practices.
- Developer With DevOps skill: implement Trunk Based development in team and accelerate team velocity, while being embedded in the team itself.

#### About This Role

This term is standard by companies, but it's often actually considered an anti-pattern by many in the development community.

*Why?*

DevOps is a term that represents the "Development + Operations" siloes being eliminated so that both Development + Operations are regularly collaborating.

[AWS - What Is DevOps?](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) says:

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
>
> This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

This means that specialization is still needed in both, but the goal is ensure clear pathways for communication.

The industry as made this term a common practice, but in most places it really could be called a: `Build & Release Engineer`.

## Skills You Might Be Looking For

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Go" open=false >}}

ðŸ’¯ Count me in!

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Terraform/Infrastructure As Code" open=false >}}

I have a lot of experience with Terraform, but end the end it's just a tool to help give value from services.

I have no problem using Pulumi, Terraform, CDK, or other tooling as a part of a role, just am not looking to do infrastructure as code work only as a full-time role.
See DevOps Engineer section for this.

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Microsoft SQL Server" open=false >}}

While I have a background strong in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) and .NET, I'm not interested in focusing my efforts on .NET.
I have a strong background in SQL Server (MSSQL) development and production database administration.
However, I've transitioned my focus to backend engineering.

In the scope of a role such as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer, I'm up for bringing this experience to bear.

However, I'm not looking for a database administration role at this time.

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title=".NET" open=false >}}
I'm primarily focusing my efforts on Go, AWS, Kubernetes, serverless and similar cloud-native development efforts.

I enjoy .NET work, but I'm not looking for a .NET focused role at this time as it is a different ecosystem than the Linux focused development I've been diving into with Go.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type="Info" title="Python" open=false >}}
Python is great, I've used for various automation tasks and I'm a fan.

However, my efforts are focused on Go right now, so a full-time Python dedicated role is not a good fit for where I'm focusing my efforts.
