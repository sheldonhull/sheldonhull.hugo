This was a beautiful quote that I had to capture from Jordan Peterson.
It wasn't the main topic, but the discussion of religous terminology came up as the guest speaker said she was raised Catholic, but had rejected this faith.
Yet, even with the rejection of faith, both her and Dr Peterson found that expressions of deep and core concepts often require borrowing from the domain of the sacred.
Not only does it provide weight, but without it can be difficult to find the words to convey concepts that have more tremendous substance to them.
