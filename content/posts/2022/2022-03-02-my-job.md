Acted like I wasn't going to go to work today with my 4 year old daughter.
She looked over at me and told me I don't have to go somewhere, I just walk up the stairs.
"Your boss will want you to go to work today".
Very astitute, I observed.

But what do I do when I go to work?
Do I fix cars, construction, or other things?

She looked at at me and said I put on my headset and talk to people about important stuff.

No cool computer hacker cred for me today.
