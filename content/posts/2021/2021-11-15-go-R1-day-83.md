## progress

Revisited Ultimate Syntax (Ardan Labs - Bill Kennedy) and went back through various topics such as:

- Variables: When to use var vs walrus operator for readability and zero value initialization.
- Type Conversions: How identical named types aren't the same in Go's eyes when named.
- Pointers: General overview. Mostly stuff I knew, but good basic overview again.
