It's really hard to prioritize when life gets busy, but it's important that continued improvement is a priority.

[Great at Work: How Top Performers Do Less, Work Better, and Achieve More](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Performers-Less-Achieve/dp/1501179519) was a really interesting book.
The fact that small incremental improvement done daily can make such a difference is pretty interesting.

It's similar to Agile tenets in how to approach software design.
Smaller iterations with rapid feedback is better than large isolated batches work delivered without regular feedback.

If you find yourself saying, "But I don't have time" or "When I have some time" it might be indicative of a failure to grasp this.
When I catch myself saying this I try to reword it and say "Whenever I make time for this" instead.

You'll always have pressure on you.
The further along in your career and life you go, the more pressure is likely to be on you.

You have to "make" time for improvement and learning if it's a priority.
