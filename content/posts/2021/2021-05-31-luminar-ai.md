## My Credentials

None. 😀

I'm a software engineer working with AWS mostly.

I'd be considered a "prosumer" with video and photography, in that I use high quality gear when possible, have comfort with professional video editing software, and have used Photoshop, Lightroom, Gimp, and other tools of a similar nature.

This is a quick review from someone who found Lightroom to overall a freeing experiencing in photography workflow.

For my occasional usage, I'm not excited to pay the subscription fee, so my Lightroom 6 standalone license is all I've continued with.



## Scope

- Casual impressions only.
- This is not in-depth review from a photography specialist.
- My focus is:

  - user experience
  - application stability
  - lock-in
  - library management (the one thing Lightroom seems to do better than any other app I've tried)

## First Look

The very first look of the library view was pretty bad.

I'm not certain what's going on, but the raw file previews in the library view loaded in a way that made my daughter look like she was being viewed through one of those warping mirrors.

The library management workflow was pretty snappy, so I was overall happy with that.

I do miss Lightroom Survey view, but no other app has had that kind of compare interface that I've discovered so far.

## Templates

The template presets for portrait did well out of the gate.

I was even able to enhance the eyes and change the color of the eyes completely with a few clicks.

A few preset adjustments such as "Face AI" allowed editing the light on the face to help brighten just the face without any need to mask.

## Editing

❎ Many of the AI powered tools were gimmicky to me.

❎ Mystical, Glow, Dramatic, all tended to be pretty over the top when max, though perhaps a little touch of each might work.

✅ The composition auto leveler was nice.

✅ Enhance tool was subtle and tasteful

✅ The ability to apply a preset then jump tweaking the presets applied changes was intuitive and well done.

✅ The erase tool did great at removing a sign from a brick wall with seconds of effort.

## Overall Verdict

Overall good quick intuitive workflow.

Value propisition is more difficult to determine.

I had Luminar 2018 and Luminar 3. Both weren't a great experience on the PC and never really got much value from them.

I could see this being a viable raw editing workflow for me though, considering the overall license cost would be significantly less than many other competitors.
