## progress

- Did iteration exercise, however, I skipped ahead and did `strings.Repeat` instead of iteration because I'm lazy. ðŸ˜€
- Moved all tests into blackbox test packages.
- Worked through variadiac functions.
- Tweaked my VSCode autotest to run on save.
- Further tweaks to `golanglint-ci` to reduce noise on linting checks.
