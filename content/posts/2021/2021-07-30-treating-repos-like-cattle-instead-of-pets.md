## Glue Work

I've been thinking on the approach that Cloudposse has taken in this project:

> [GitHub - cloudposse/build-harness: ðŸ¤–Collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness)

When managing many repos I think that  concept is so freaking amazing. Why aren't more tools centrally synced and updated like this!

It's sorta like we treat repos as "pets" rather than cattle with our tooling.
I think this is where github actions is so amazing, as they've brought in ways to use organizational level definitions to run and reuse.

Tools like "cookie-cutter" or github repo templates seem nice, but I think they might be a bandaid.
They are solving the problem of making it faster to setup a new project with tooling and structure.

If there is a tool like build-harness though, customizing automation tooling becomes a breeze as you just sync the latest defaults.

## Docker

Docker solves much more of the problem by wrapping up tools and dependencies in a single package that can be reused in many projects.

It does come with the downside of a less friendly interface, but there are options around this.
Debugging and running compiled applications is also possible, yet does come with the downside of added complexity.

## A Happy Mix

Maybe the mix of task definitions in Docker, while not expecting developers to run every single command fully embedded in Docker is a happy medium?
