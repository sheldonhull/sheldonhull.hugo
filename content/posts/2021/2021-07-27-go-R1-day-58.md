## progress

- Built some Mage tasks for setup of local projects.
- Used retool post from Nate Finch with Mage project and found it promising to vendor Go based tooling into a local project and not rely on the global package library.
- Created `magetools` repo to house some basic general mage tasks I could share with other projects.

```go
year, month, day := time.Now().Date()
dateString := fmt.Sprintf("%d-%02d-%d", year, month, day)
```

Use padding in the `Sprintf` call to ensure a date comes back with `07` instead of `7`.
