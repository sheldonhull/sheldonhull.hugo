## progress

- Did some work on Go regex processing with a new linting tool concept I have for "semantic line breaks".
- I've forced myself to apply TDD from the get go, so it's been slow going initially to abstract my functions to be testable without being run as a CLI tool.
- Started on the run test for simulating the cli call as well.
