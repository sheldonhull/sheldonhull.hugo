## progress

- Finished up the basics of dependency injection and how this helps with testable code.
- Worked through concurrency test using channels and go routines.
This will take a bit more to get comfortable with as there is a variety of concepts here.
My initial attempts finally started working using an anonymous function, but couldn't finalize due to some issue with launching the parallel executable being called.
Not sure why the `--argname` seemed to be trimming the first dash from the argument when using `args = append(args,"--argname 5")`.

I sure enjoy the visuals from pterm library.
When not using the `-debug` flag, the concurrent counter reported a nice increase of total threads and then exited upon failure of any goroutine.
