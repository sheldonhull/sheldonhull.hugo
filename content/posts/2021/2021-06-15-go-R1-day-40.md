## progress

- Learned a bit more modules vs packages, including internal package special behavior.
- Configured Azure DevOps remote module source with package level imports.
- Successfully migrated a utility logger for setup of Zerolog into a seperate remote module for importing.
- Setup 50% test coverage for logger using `gotest` test generator.
- Used [Is](https://github.com/matryer/is) for test setup. (this would be a cool use of gotest templates test generation)
- Modified sharedbrain forked repo to generate yaml front matter with dashes.
