## progress

- Learned a bit about idiomatic patterns wtih error handling.
- Learned about inline block intiailization of variables using `if err := method(); err != nil {...}` approach.
- Considered a bit more idiomatic patterns when I noticed excessibe nested if blocks.

```go
tfdir := tf.Params().String("tfdir")
if tfdir != "" {
  tf.Logf("tfdir set to: [%s]", tfdir)
} else {
  tf.Errorf("ðŸ§ª failed to get tfdir parameter: [%v]", tfdir)
}
```

This would probably be more in alignment with Go standards by writing as:

```go
tfdir := tf.Params().String("tfdir")
if tfdir == "" {
  tf.Errorf("ðŸ§ª failed to get tfdir parameter: [%v]", tfdir)
  return
}
tf.Logf("tfdir set to: [%s]", tfdir)
```

This reduces the noise and keeps things pretty flat.
