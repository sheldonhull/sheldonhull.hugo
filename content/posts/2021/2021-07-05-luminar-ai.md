> [!note] Update+
> Customer service bumped my older version of Luminar 3 to 4.
> The issues with distortion on the preview screen aren't there with version 4.
>
> The new AI enhancements aren't there, so it's missing some of the new features.
> For now I'm going to try and use this as my daily driver for images and see how it goes.
>
> Positive experience so far, though I still miss the fluid experience of Lightroom's preview modes.

## My Credentials

None. ðŸ˜€

I'm a software engineer working with AWS mostly.

I'd be considered a "prosumer" with video and photography, in that I use high quality gear when possible, have comfort with professional video editing software, and have used Photoshop, Lightroom, Gimp, and other tools of a similar nature.

This is a quick review from someone who found Lightroom to overall a freeing experiencing in photography workflow.

For my occasional usage, I'm not excited to pay the subscription fee, so my Lightroom 6 standalone license is all I've continued with.

## Scope

- Casual impressions only.
- This is not in-depth review from a photography specialist.
- My focus is:

    - user experience
    - application stability
    - lock-in
    - library management (the one thing Lightroom seems to do better than any other app I've tried)

## First Look

The very first look of the library view was pretty bad.

I'm not certain what's going on, but the raw file previews in the library view loaded in a way that made my daughter look like she was being viewed through one of those warping mirrors.

The library management workflow was pretty snappy, so I was overall happy with that.

I do miss Lightroom Survey view, but no other app has had that kind of compare interface that I've discovered so far.

## Templates

The template presets for portrait did well out of the gate.

I was even able to enhance the eyes and change the color of the eyes completely with a few clicks.

A few preset adjustments such as "Face AI" allowed editing the light on the face to help brighten just the face without any need to mask.

## Editing

ðŸ”³ Many of the AI powered tools were gimmicky to me.

ðŸ”³ Mystical, Glow, Dramatic, all tended to be pretty over the top when max, though perhaps a little touch of each might work.

âœ… The composition auto leveler was nice.

âœ… Enhance tool was subtle and tasteful

âœ… The ability to apply a preset then jump tweaking the presets applied changes was intuitive and well done.

âœ… The erase tool did great at removing a sign from a brick wall with seconds of effort.

## Overall Verdict

Overall good quick intuitive workflow.

Value propisition is more difficult to determine.

I had Luminar 2018 and Luminar 3. Both weren't a great experience on the PC and never really got much value from them.

I could see this being a viable raw editing workflow for me though, considering the overall license cost would be significantly less than many other competitors.
