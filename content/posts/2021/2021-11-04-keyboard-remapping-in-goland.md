This is a continuation of my evaluation using Goland.

I tend to be a VSCode user primarily, but am working on adopting Goland incrementally to leverage some of it's features that work a bit more consistently (like refactoring).

Losing keyboard shortcuts is painful.

VSCode lets you assign keyboard shortcuts in command pallette by clicking on the gear icon in the command you hover over.
For a while I couldn't find this in Goland.
I see now I can assign any action defined from the quick open menu by pressing `Cmd+.`.

This should expedite keyboard shortcut customization to align to my muscle memory a bit easier.
