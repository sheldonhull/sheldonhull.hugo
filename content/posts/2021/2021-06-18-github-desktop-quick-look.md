GitHub desktop has come a long way to helping new users with a GitHub Flow development workflow.

Some great features I've seen in latest updates (`Version 2.9.0 (x64)` on macOS)

- No list of repos in sidebar or ability to add many at once. (edit... you can drag directories... still no pinned sidebar like VSCode/Fork)
- Being able to squash commits by just dragging is a great design decision.
Having to click to rebase on GitGraph or other tools always feels easy to do wrong.
- Update from `main` already built in.
This is fantastic, and I can see how this provides a UI to do something similar to [Git Town](https://www.git-town.com/) which I blogged on earlier here: [2021-02-23-git-workflow-with-git-town](./2021-02-23-git-workflow-with-git-town/)

## Things Missing

These are things I personally value that keep me from using as my main git experience.

- No graph view. I like the visual
- Super nice options for easy update
