## progress

- published extension pack for Go[^ext]
- Learned about magic number linter in `golanglint-ci`.
For instance this would be flagged as a bad practice (while not applicable for a simple test like this, having a const makes sense in almost all other cases).

```go
func Perimeter(width float64, height float64) float64 {
	return 2 * (width + height)
}
```

- Learned a few extra linter violations and how to exclude including:
    - `lll`: for maximum line length
    - `packagetest`: for emphasizing blackbox testing.
    - `gochecknoglobals`: for ensuring global variables aren't used
    - `nlreturn`: for returning without a black line before.
    That's a "nit", but nice for consistency (though I'd like to see this as an autoformatted rule with fix applied.)
