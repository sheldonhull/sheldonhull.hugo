## progress

- figured out how to import `util/logger.go` as a package
- after much confusion due to `logger`, `log`, `*zerolog.Logger` and more variables all deviously similar in name... how to pass around the initialized package logger that I configure.
- learned that global scope and package scoped loggers being initialized at run is concerned an anti-pattern
- properly wrapping to avoid the log initialization on import with `type Logger struct { logger: *zerolog.Logger; }` as an example avoids the same behavior as: `var Log *zerolog.Logger`
- will evaluate better scoping in the future, but for now figured it would be a ðŸš€ #shipit moment to improve as I can later. [^package-level-logger]
