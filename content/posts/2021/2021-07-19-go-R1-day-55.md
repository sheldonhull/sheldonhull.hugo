## progress

> In Go, when you call a function or a method the arguments are copied. [^pointers]

- Built some test cases for working with pointers and test methods.
- Did this in Goland to become more familar with it and figured out how to use the nice tests explorer with a floating window to auto-test.
- Built a filewatcher configuration watcher as alternative to tests panel, allowing automated run in terminal or output panel of `go test ./...`.
- Couldn't figure out how to run every test in project, as it's a multi-module repo (for tutorials).
VSCode works fine with this with the multi-module support.

> These pointers to structs even have their own name: struct pointers and they are automatically dereferenced.  [^pointers]

This explains something that felt a little confusing as a new Gopher.
Now I know why returning a value back as an int didn't require explicit dereferencing. [^dereferencing]

```go
func (w *Wallet) Balance() int {
  return w.balance // <---- automatically deferenced
}
```

Not clear yet on if I need to set the `is := New(t)` in the context of each `t.Run()` or not.

```go
t.Run("withdraw 2 amounts", func(t *testing.T) {
		wallet := pointers.Wallet{}
		wallet.Deposit(pointers.Bitcoin(20))
		err := wallet.Withdraw(pointers.Bitcoin(5))
		is.NoErr(err) // Withdraw should have no errors
		assertBalance(t, &wallet, pointers.Bitcoin(15))
	})
```
