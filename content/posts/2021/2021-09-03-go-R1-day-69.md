## progress

- Read on functional options in Go. I've seen this used with Pterm, Zerolog, and other tools, but didn't know this pattern had a name.
- WalkDir is a newer function available in Go 1.16.
It's recommended for future work, but found very few examples.
Adjusted my line break code to use `WalkDir`.
