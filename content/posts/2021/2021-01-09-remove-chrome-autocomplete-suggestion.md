Do you have a Chrome suggestion for a domain, url, or specific site location that you don't want anymore?

You can remove an invalid suggestion that you don't want popping up each time by using `shift+delete`.

If it's the first entry it will remove it, or use arrow keys to highlight a different entry and press the same command.
