Nice little site I came across for comparing various popular knowledge & note taking tools with ability to select features most important to you.

[NoteApps](https://www.noteapps.info/apps/compare?note_app=bear%2Bnotion%2Bobsidian&selected_group=appearance#compare-preface)

Note typically a fan of compare based tools, as they often feel like marketing junk, but this was a a pretty cool little implementation.
