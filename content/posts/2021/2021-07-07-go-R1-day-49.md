## progress

- Learned about White-Box vs Black-Box testing.
Apparently, you can access all indentifiers of a package if you use the same package name such as: `package packagename`.
If you are testing as a consumer might be, then you can use `package packagename_test` for only accessing the exported identifiers.
- Used examples in test file to provide self-documentation of how to use the method.
- Worked further with `golanglint-ci` and found it challenging when working with multiple modules in subdirectories.
The go eco system systems simplest with one repo = one module.
While mono-repos can work, the CI tooling isn't quite as intuitive to setup.
VSCode requires experimental support for multiple modules as well at this time.
