Open IntelliJ via terminal: ` open "/Users/$(whoami)/Applications/JetBrains Toolbox/IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.app"`

This will ensure your `.profile`, `.bashrc`, and other profile settings that might be loading some default environment variables are available to your IDE.
For macOS, you'd have to set in the `environment.plist` otherwise to ensure they are available to a normal application.
