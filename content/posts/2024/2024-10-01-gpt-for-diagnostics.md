Testing a new setup with Fossi Audio BT20A-PRO paired with my old Polk RTI-A1 bookshelf speakers.
I was tired of hearing muddy music through Alexa.

One of them was giving me problems and was pretty erratic.

The right channel sounded really thin, but the next day after trying different cables, it sounded muddy.

This is where tools like ChatGPT provide a great starting point.
Describing the problem revealed my speaker was bi-ampable, and tightening the jumper/bridge plate solved it.

I've had some success using this approach with basic car troubleshooting too.

It's like having an eager subject matter expert in your pocket.
As long as you take it with a grain of salt and don't rely on it too much, you can get great results âœ¨.
