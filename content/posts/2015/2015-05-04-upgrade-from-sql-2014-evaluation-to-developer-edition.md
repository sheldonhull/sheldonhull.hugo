Couldn't find documentation showing that upgrade from SQL 2014 evaluation version was possible to developer edition. I just successfully converted an evaluation version to developer edition.

1.  Obtain the key for the developer edition (in my case I had to download the .ISO from MSDN downloads, and go through the installation wizard to get it)
2.  Run the installation center app for SQL Server 2014
3.  Select edition upgrade
4.  Plug in your new serial from the developer edition. Pretty simply, but thought I'd post a confirmation for anyone wanting confirmation the upgrade path was an option for developer. Probably somewhere in the MSDN documentation, but I couldn't find it with a quick search.
