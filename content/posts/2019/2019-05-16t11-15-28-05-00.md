Downloading a Visual Studio Code vsix extension and then installing manually in Azure Data Studio works for some extensions! For instance, downloading [_Simple Alignment_](http://bit.ly/2Ef3nxU "Simple Alignment") from the marketplace, and then running in Azure Data Studio successfully installed the utility.

You can also many of your keyboard settings straight from vscode into Azure Data Studio so you don't have to remap all those keys. The beauty of json configuration files :smile:
