I'd read about Terraform 0.12 and thought it was much further out, so moved on with regret from evaluating the massive number of improvements. Just found out it was released, and `choco upgrade terraform -y` provided me with a delightful `0.12` upgrade. If you haven't explored it yet, go do it!

Things like loops, no longer having to reference any variable with string interpolation, and more promises to make this a big productivity improvement for those enjoying Terraform.

If you aren't using any _Infrastructure-As-Code_ approach right now, you'll find it initially a little confusing, but get past that and you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
