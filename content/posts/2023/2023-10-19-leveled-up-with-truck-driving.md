I bought my car, a 2010 Mazdaspeed3, without knowing how to drive a manual tranmission.
Thanks to my buddy Jake driving it home, we brought it back.
I got a late night crash course in a parking lot, and this saw me through the first month.[^crashcourse]

I might have killed the engine a few times[^killedit].

So this last week, I drove another stick for the first time.
Despite all this time, I realized I'd only driven my Mazdaspeed3.
It's a very touchy and tight sports clutch.

I had to dry a 1998 Ford F150 for the first time and felt like I leveled up.

Didn't kill it once.
Listened to the rumble of the truck.
Checked out the cassette player.

Back to my car now.
I was a real man for a bit.

[^crashcourse]: He might have aged a few years and had some blood pressure issues from the experience.
[^killedit]: Well, more like every trip...
