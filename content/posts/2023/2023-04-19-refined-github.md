After using this for a while, I figured I'd add this to my my "cool-tools" list.

[![refined-github/refined-github - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/refined-github/refined-github.svg)](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github)

The main features I've found useful:

- Use keyboard to flip straight to code review with approve/reject focused.
- Highlight the code most recently changed in the browser.

There's a whole list on the repo page of small usability tweaks for those living in GitHub, for example [Repositories Tweaks](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github#repositories).

Give it a try!
