Split my blog into [notes.sheldonhull.com](https://notes.sheldonhull.com) for evergreen note taking and reference content.
I'll still maintain this blog for posts.

Mkdocs allows a minimal friction to publishing and previewing.
The directory structure is built automatically from directories.

While I love Hugo, it's more work to maintain small reference pages so I'm going to split up my notes more like a "digital garden" approach.

- Free hosting through GitHub.
- 60 seconds from push to page refresh.

In comparison, Obsidian Publish and others can run $100+ a year.
