Most of the basic foods lack the same preservatives, food dye, and corn syrup that we commonly have in non-speciality foods in Europe.
Lays potato chips at the local market are "natural" and contain far less salt and really taste great.

Lower your expectations with spice though.
Last salsa I tried was tomato paste.
I asked for the Thai medium spice and it's like a desert.

They seriously must not like their taste buds to tingle like us Texans.

I'm going through taco withdrawals.
I need me some serrano peppers soon.
