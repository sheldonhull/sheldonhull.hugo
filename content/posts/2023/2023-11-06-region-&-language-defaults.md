Language defaults seem to be an interesting mix when it comes to websites.
The results that show up for a different search region can also be different based on Google's docs [Search Region](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/873?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&sjid=15123736862072240189-EU)

One video streaming site refused to show me subtitles in English without me using a VPN to appear as a US member.
My quick search through some posts on reddit and the like show this can be a really inconsistent mess depending on the site.
