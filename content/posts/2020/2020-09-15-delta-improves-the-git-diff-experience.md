Checkout [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for a much-improved git diff experience.
I typically use VSCode or a GUI based editor because I find the diff view pretty messy by default.

This new diff view is a perfect example of a simple CLI tool that improves a development workflow by just fixing something I didn't know could easily be fixed. ðŸ˜€
