Visual Studio Code has a pretty great way to browse through themes by just selecting installed themes and using arrow keys to preview without apply. However, browsing those themes isn't quite so good, as you need to install to see the changes.

Ran across [Vscode Themes](https://vscodethemes.com/ https://bit.ly/2NHNsMW "Vscode Themes") which provides a really nice experience if you feel like changing things up on your editor.
