My morning. Explaining set and intersect theory basics to my 10 year old with Minecraft gamer tags.
Trying to justify the need to know this, the best I could come up with was his future need to build a shark attack report accurately.

Kids are the best. Tech is fun. What job would have me spin up with `docker-compose up -d` my MSSQL container, write a quick SQL example with `INTERSECT`, `UNION` and all to demonstrate this magic.

Followed it up with a half-hearted lie that my day is comprised of `cmatrix` ðŸ˜‚  which he didn't believe for more than a couple seconds.
