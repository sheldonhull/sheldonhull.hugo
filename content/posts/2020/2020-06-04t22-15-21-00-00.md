- add dev container configuration for Go project in Visual Studio code
- Added docker compose file
- Add SQL Server to compose as another service.
- `docker-compose up -d`
- Attach to running container in VSCode
- Magic âš¡

Now I can open Visual Studio Code and run a go project against SQL Server, and tear it all down as I want. Gonna definitely blog on this, as it's super cool to see this work so well.

While Docker has a steep learning curve, being able to have a full clean dev test environment with SQL Server in a local container and another Ubuntu container to run Go projects in absolutely amazing, not to mention working "inside it" with Remote Workspaces extension from Microsoft.
