Jedi: Fallen Order has the most linear gameplay I've done in a while. View map, get object, run for 15 mins to get back to beginning of map. Rinse and repeat. Feels like I'm back to Skyrim and endless walking. I think Dying Light ruined me with it's parkour and movement dynamics that made everything feel so immersive.
