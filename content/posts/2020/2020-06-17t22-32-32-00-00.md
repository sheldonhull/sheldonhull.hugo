Here's a cool way to visualize runspaces and how they work asynchronously.

```powershell
$IndentLevel = 2
Get-Random; @(1..100) | ForEach-Object -Parallel {
    $i = $_
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds (Get-Random -Minimum 100 -Maximum 1500)
    "{0,$($i * $using:IndentLevel)}" -f $i | Write-Host
}
```

The random delay can help show how some tasks finish out of order.
For example, running that might result in this in the console:

```text
       4
 1
     3
   2
             7
         5
                 9
           6
                  10
               8
```
