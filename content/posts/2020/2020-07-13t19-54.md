PowerShell has some functionality that can help in pre-processing data by grouping and aggregating.
If you are using `ImportExcel` this might be useful to pre-aggregate the results prior to an Excel workbook.
If you are working with PowerShell and needing to do some quick measurement of objects, maybe this will be useful.
