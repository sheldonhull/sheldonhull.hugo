Finally got [atomic algolia](https://forestry.io/blog/search-with-algolia-in-hugo/) to work in CICD for my hugo blog. I've tried tackling this in many ways over time, but this finally just worked with plug and play ease thanks to just adding a line to the hugo build `netlify.toml` file.

If you want to try this out, assuming you've already got an algolia index, json file generated and all... then just:

1. Setup env variables in netlify build
2. Add the following line to your netlify production build script

```shell
echo "Starting atomic-algolia update"
npm run algolia
```

You should get the following output from your netlify build if everything went right. No hits to algolia if you didn't change your indexes! ðŸŽ‰
