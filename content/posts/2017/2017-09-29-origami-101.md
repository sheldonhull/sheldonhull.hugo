My son and i have begun exploring origami.

Few things I've learned....

- Patience is key

- The right paper matters for trying intermediate models with lots of folds or 3d models needing some shape control. I wasted nearly 2 hours on one complex design with 2 hours of work left... And had to stop as the paper was almost splitting from the work I had put into it.

- Advanced origami is insanely complex, and only in recent years morphed into a realistic portrayal of objects due to advances in mathematics in origami pioneers. (See Robert Lang, Eric Joisel for examples)

- Advanced origami practitioners typically are wet folding paper to allow shaping flexibility

This is a fun start but definitely have a long way to go! I look forward to trying more soon, as it's been a great way to spend some relaxing time and more so to have a great connection with my son.
