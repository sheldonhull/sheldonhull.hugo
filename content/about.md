## Core Values

I live as a follower of Christ, desiring to impact the world around with who He is. I'm an unashamed disciple and though I've got plenty I mess up, following Him is my joy. I'm passionate about worship through music, and have played and led worship team for a number of years. Currently, I've been enjoying playing electric. This had challenged me to play in a completely different way than acoustic, as the melodic nature of the electric guitar parts bring a subtle but powerful part to a worship band.

## Family

I've been blessed with 3 kids and a wonderful wife Sarah who has brought beauty into my world and to my life. I'm thankful for the richness of family and experiencing this journey.

## Work

{{<button href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/sheldonhull" theme="success">}} Resume/Developer Story {{< /button >}}

I‚Äôve got over 8 years of experience working database performance tuning & design. I‚Äôve worked with AWS, been involved with disaster recovery & scalability planning, automation, extensive exposure to .NET, DevOps practices, and more.

I'm obsessed with automation and making tools and processes more streamlined to improve everyone's day.

I ‚ô• code

Software, Infrastructure-as-code, Compliance-as-code, my resume as code... you name it üòÅ

With a passion for automation and excellence I‚Äôm a good fit for a DevOps culture that believes in agility and quality. I enjoy blogging at sheldonhull.com and contributing back to the open-source community when possible. I use spaces, Vscode City Lights dark theme, ligature fonts, ultrawide monitor, GitHub, and craft magic from this. I'm also guilty of trying out far too many terminal enhancements and trying to convince myself my Windows 10 shell will someday be as cool as Oh My Zsh. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I also think the world needs more emojis and tacos üåÆüåÆüåÆ

## Other Interests

My passions extend beyond technology into the creative realm as well. I've enjoyed doing videography, photography, and creating music. Electric & acoustic guitar have always been a passion. I'm a sucker for good post-rock music, which I think is the best type of music for coding around.
