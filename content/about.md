## Core Values

I live as a follower of Christ, desiring to impact the world around with who He is. I'm an unashamed disciple and though I've got plenty I mess up, following Him is my joy. I'm passionate about worship through music, and have played and led worship team for a number of years. Currently, I've been enjoying playing electric. This had challenged me to play in a completely different way than acoustic, as the melodic nature of the electric guitar parts bring a subtle but powerful part to a worship band.

## Family

I've been blessed with 3 kids and a wonderful wife Sarah who has brought beauty into my world and to my life. I'm thankful for the richness of family and experiencing this journey.

## Work

I specialize in working with SQL Server to help speed things up, and develop solutions focused on SQL Server. I have a passion for automation, streamlining, implementing a healthy Database Lifecycle Management (DLM) process. I've additionally dived into PowerShell to help automate many of the tasks for testing and deploying SQL databases, as well as some projects with C#. I've been excited to be part of the #sqlfamily and connect with various members online that have helped provide such a rich experience for the community to draw on and learn from. AWS is a big part of my work, and I've run performance related testing, configuration, and other stuff up in the magical land of the cloud. I've worked a little with Azure as well.

I'm allergic to red-tape, excessive emails, meetings for the sake of meetings, and busy work for the sake of busy work. I like to bring real value and see the company and client's work impacted for the better thanks to my efforts. Saving folks some money and time is always a win!

## Other Interests

My passions extend beyond technology into the creative realm as well. I've enjoyed doing videography, photography, and creating music. I've been honored to serve as an associate pastor of worship for a period of time, and still engage in church community with the goal of loving like Jesus demonstrated. I'm a sucker for good post-rock music, which I think is the best type of music for coding around.
