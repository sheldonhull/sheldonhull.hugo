## Core Values

I live as a follower of Christ, desiring to impact the world around with who He is. I'm an unashamed disciple and though I've got plenty I mess up, following Him is my joy. I'm passionate about worship through music, and have played and led worship team for a number of years. Currently, I've been enjoying playing electric. This had challenged me to play in a completely different way than acoustic, as the melodic nature of the electric guitar parts bring a subtle but powerful part to a worship band.

## Family

I've been blessed with 3 kids and a wonderful wife Sarah who has brought beauty into my world and to my life. I'm thankful for the richness of family and experiencing this journey.

## Work

I â™¥ code

I also think the world needs more emojis and tacos ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ® to lighten things up.

If you are bored and want to see my brag sheet, here you go: [brag sheet]({{< relref "brag.md" >}})

It's a :construction: wip that I plan on adding some accomplishments to over time.

## Other Interests

My passions extend beyond technology into the creative realm as well.
I've enjoyed doing videography, photography, and creating music.
Electric & acoustic guitar have always been a passion.
I'm a sucker for good post-rock music, which I think is the best type of music for coding around.
