# Go R1 Day 25


## Day 25 of 100

## progress

- Worked with Gorm, my first experience with ORM based querying.
- Used `gofakeit` with gorm to connect to MSSQL Server in Docker and randomize name entries.
- Learned a bit about `Context` package and how it helps with propagation of cancellation.
- As a new user to this, the examples were very confusing as it mixed up go-mssqldb along with examples using just gorm.
As I get better with it, I&#39;ll try to log better introductory examples.
