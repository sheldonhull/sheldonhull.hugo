# Multi-Cursor Editing SQL feels like the movie Inception just became real


*   Yes... multicursor editing is epic
*   No... SSMS doesn&#39;t support multi-cursor editing the way it should.
*   Yes... you can do some basic editing with multiple lines using alt-shift
*   No... it doesn&#39;t come close to what you can do with Sublime.
Cool thing is you can open text in Sublime synced w/SSMS cursor position and switch between the two with a shortcut. That will be a post for another day, I&#39;m just telling you now to get your appetite going.
If you can&#39;t tell, I love shortcuts. Sublime &#43; AHK pretty much covers most text editing needs you&#39;ll ever have.
Feel free to send me a check for all the time you&#39;ll save from my revelation.
I apologize in advance for the video quality. I plan on recording a better one in the future, after I wrap my head around the awesomeness of Camtasia Studio 8
