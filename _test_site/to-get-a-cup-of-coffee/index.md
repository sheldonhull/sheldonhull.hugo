# To Get a Cup of Coffee


- Take the car into shop to get state inspection that&#39;s overdue, since I don&#39;t drive it much.
- Find out a check engine light fails the test.
- Drive towards grocery store near house, and hit a long line of traffic.
- Decide to be a dilligent budgeter and pick up milk instead of buying coffee.
- Train decides to park at road I have to cross.
- Go to gas station, grab milk.
- Arrive home.
- Make coffee.

Sometimes working from an office has it&#39;s advantages, especially those fancy places with free lattes (looking at you LinkedIn!)
