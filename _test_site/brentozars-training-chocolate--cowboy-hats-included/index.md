# Brentozar&#39;&#39;s Training: Chocolate &amp; Cowboy Hats Included


It was entertaining to listen to a technical wizard fighting the obsession with waiting to eat chocolate with 3k viewers watching. Kendra wore about 4-5 cowboy hats in an effort to help those of us who wear many hats feel welcome.... Now that&#39;s the kinda of training I enjoy! No pretense, just honest real, and insightful training with enjoyable humor included for free

**Highly recommend attending the webex presentations occurring today and tomorrow with Brent Ozar and his amazing team.** They are giving back to the community with some excellent training and Q&amp;A. Attended the Shared Storage discussion yesterday and wasn&#39;t disappointed (I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve ever disappointed with their training!)
Register for the training now, as it is the second of the 3 days, with the first training occurring here @ 10am CST.
