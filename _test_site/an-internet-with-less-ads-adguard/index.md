# An Internet With Less Ads - Adguard


# Ads...I know they employ people, make the world go round, gave us google.... but seriously I hate almost all ads.

If my ranking in google search drops to the end because of this post... well.... I&#39;m ok with that.

## Adguard

I&#39;ve been using this for over a year as a beta tester (they provided license for me to test and use latest versions). I had a perfect case to demo the craziness of some sites with ads vs using Adguard the other day and figured I&#39;d share it if you... like me... hate the clutter they provide on many sites.
Now, note that other factors come into play here. For example, the site I hite should have been using some optimization for images presented. This site was pretty insane on the ad content, so others aren&#39;t as dramatic. I just saw this as a Google Now recommended article and checked it out.

## Site With Less Ads

WITH ADGUARD

2.2 MB for a single webpage load
Finish Time 7.23sec
This was loaded with the mobile emulator. If you are paying for data (for instance I&#39;m on Project Fi), this could be a huge difference in your browsing bandwidth.

## Side by Side

This blew my mind. According to Adguard metrics it had saved me over 2GB. Now, even taking this with a grain of salt, I was still pretty impressed by the results. I can immediately tell when I&#39;m not running Adguard on android as the ads are everywhere.
Adguard android has some additional functionality that provides the ability to create a local VPN and filter apps as well, so if you are using some app that has a annoying banner add right near the menu, this will most likely eliminate it.
This is a pretty big image, and I blurred out text/ads to avoid any issues. Any guess at which one was the one with Adguard running?

## Final Thoughts

There are options to allow some &#34;acceptable&#34; ads. Not interested in this personally, but those who are should know it&#39;s offered. Cost can be a little higher than some options due to yearly cost, but the reward of a constantly developing product seems worth it, especially for folks that browse a lot.

Only con I&#39;ve come across with this is custom filtering options are a bit confusing for a non-technical user. Hopefully this will improve in the future to offer a much easier ad editing experience like some other similar toolkits. Lastly, a better notification of potentially blocking issues would be nice. I&#39;ve come across a few sites that Adguard has blocked on various scripts or other &#34;needed&#34; actions that prevent the site from working. Disabling temporarily is acceptable for me, as this is quick with the chrome extension (pause for 30 secs). I&#39;d say a better notification system, if even possible, on potentially site disrupting scripts/cookies blocked would be great enhancement.
Overall, highly recommend this cross platform solution if you are looking for a better way to browse... with less ads!
