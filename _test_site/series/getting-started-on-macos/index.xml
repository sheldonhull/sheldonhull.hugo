        <p>I lost roughly half a day in productivity. CPU hit 100% for an extended period, making it difficult to even use the terminal.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the culprit was Docker, as it was running some activity with local codespaces and linting tools.
Killing Docker did nothing.</p>
<p>Htop pointed out kernel as the primary hog, and you can&rsquo;t kill that.</p>
<p>After digging around online, I found further mentions about charging on the right side, not the left to avoid thermal issues causing CPU throttling.</p>
<p>The white charger cable wasn&rsquo;t plugged in.
The phone charger was, but the white cable to the laptop charger wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was drawing power from the dock, which doesn&rsquo;t provide the same output as the Apple charger (seems to be a common issue).</p>
<p>This Stack Exchange question pointed me back to checking the charging: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/363337/how-to-find-cause-of-high-kernel-task-cpu-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">macos - How to find cause of high kernel_task cpu usage? - Ask Different</a></p>
<p>I was skeptical of this being the root cause of kernel CPU usage, but once I plugged in the charger, the CPU issue resolved itself within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>This is completely ridiculous.
If throttling is occurring, a polished user experience would be to notify of insufficient power from charger, not hammer my performance.
Additionally, it seems odd how many docking stations I&rsquo;ve looked at for my Mac don&rsquo;t provide the minimum required power to sustain heavy usage.</p>
<p>While I still enjoy using the Mac, having 4 cables coming out from it to use at my desk compared to my older Lenovo/HP docking station experience feels like a subpar experience.</p>

        <p>Open IntelliJ via terminal: <code> open &quot;/Users/$(whoami)/Applications/JetBrains Toolbox/IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.app&quot;</code></p>
<p>This will ensure your <code>.profile</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, and other profile settings that might be loading some default environment variables are available to your IDE.
For macOS, you&rsquo;d have to set in the <code>environment.plist</code> otherwise to ensure they are available to a normal application.</p>

        <p>It should be easy to pick a default program to open a file. On macOS, I was surprised at how poor the design was. Seriously, how is this intuitive? <code>Open With</code> &gt; <code> Set this as default</code>. Apparently this only set it for an individual file. This means, every different <code>csv</code> file required me to do this again.</p>
<p>Instead, I had to <code>Get Info</code> &gt; <code>Unlock settings</code> and then choose the default <code>Open With</code> setting, and further select <code>Use this application to open all documents like this.</code></p>
<p>I enjoy most of my development experience with macOS.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try and tell me that it is the pinnacle of usability though, some of this stuff is just quirky and over complicated. In what world, should my default behavior be set on a specific file and not the the file type?</p>

        <p>After using Windows versions of launchers that tried to emulate <a href="https://bit.ly/2A3J08c" title="Alfred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfred</a>, I finally took the plunge and bought Alfred&rsquo;s Powerpack. The buyer remorse of paying &gt; $60 on a &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; app hasn&rsquo;t really set in as I&rsquo;m seeing such a wealth of great features that I think the gains as a developer and shortcut aficionado will be well worth the cost in my workflow. So far, highly recommend. The best part for me is the easy plugging in of bash/pwsh scripts to execute on demand for quick productivity tasks without having to navigate and open it up in the terminal.</p>

    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content"><p>updated with fresh thoughts</p>
<p>Regarding stability issues, I&rsquo;d say those initial stability issues haven&rsquo;t continued, so I&rsquo;m very happy with the overall stability.
The only thing that really gave me pain was DisplayLink drivers, which seem to always be a pain on Windows or MacOS.</p>

<h2 id="my-background" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#my-background" class="header-mark"></a>My background</h2><p>My background has been very strongly focused on the .NET world, with a focused start on SQL Server, later branching into learning PowerShell.
This world was heavily focused on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="why-switch" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#why-switch" class="header-mark"></a>Why switch</h2><p>Having focused on Windows for so long, using a Macbook for development always intrigued me, but was actually not the driving factor.
Poor specs and performance issues with the currently issued laptop kept impacting my work, causing impact to my efforts. As my work right now is heavily focused in DevOps oriented areas, I found that the reliance on tooling that only worked in Windows over time has greatly reduced.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m very excited for WSL2 with Windows, what I kept feeling like I was doing was battling my system instead of accomplishing the work I needed to get done.
As someone who has been an obsessive tweaker of whatever OS I&rsquo;m on, I&rsquo;ve actually found my desire for full customization diminishing as the development work becomes more interesting.
In this case, being able to work with more linux tooling without as much conflict was appealing.</p>
<p>Additionally, the windows specs for the workbooks I had available were definitely subpar to what a highend macbook could offer.</p>
<p>So I took the plunge, was approved thanks to a supportive manager, and now am working exclusively on a 16&quot; Macbook Pro I9.</p>
<h2 id="setup" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#setup" class="header-mark"></a>Setup</h2><p>Learned some Ansible on the fly and configured everything pretty much from the start with Ansible.
Overall, that made it a much better developer onboarding experience than trying to write my initial chocolatey package bootstrap script.</p>

Think about this from a new Windows developer perspective. Go to Program Files (x86), or Program Files, but some go into AppData, and then settings in ProgramData, but sometimes that program prefers to put some of the configuration data in the Program directory and sometimes in ProgramData&hellip;. unless they want to put it in AppData&hellip;. and then Local/Roaming etc. It gets really really confusing quick.
That&rsquo;s why tools like <em>Everything</em> are so helpful!</p>

This makes the contribution phase much more difficult in Chocolatey. I&rsquo;ve written very complex Choco packages for my company, but haven&rsquo;t yet setup a community one, whereas Brew, Scoop, and others have a central repository that you can easily submit a push request to with improvements or new additions without having to manage the autorefresh of the packages.
A minor, but important distinction to me, as the ease of contributing must be there for more people to engage in it.

<h2 id="development-experience" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#development-experience" class="header-mark"></a>Development Experience</h2><p>I feel kinda strange as I&rsquo;ve not needed to dive into system internals like I felt I needed with Windows.</p>
<p>At somepoint, I needed to touch the registry, work through service quirks, .NET library conflicts and more.</p>
<p>Overall, it feels like things are just easier and I fight less with development tools and libraries.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most hands on portion is just making sure binaries get to <code>PATH</code> as there is no real &ldquo;global variable&rdquo; like you have in Windows.
Instead, this is normally managed in the user&rsquo;s <code>.bashrc</code> file, or in my case I use <code>.profile</code> and a powershell file to load my own overrides.</p>
<h2 id="powershell--shells" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#powershell--shells" class="header-mark"></a>PowerShell &amp; Shells</h2><p>I put work into using <code>zsh</code> as my default, with a bunch of customizations.
I still came back to PowerShell ❤️.</p>
<p>PowerShell is a fantastic default shell for macOS, and allowed me to immediately get value from the terminal without having to use a specific syntax to that shell (if it isn&rsquo;t POSIX compliant like Fish)</p>
<p>With PSReadline, the editor experience and autocomplete on my history is fantastic and I have no complaints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to keep an open mind and not &ldquo;hate on bash/fish/zsh&rdquo;, as they have a long history.
I can see if someone has a background in Linux only, that PowerShell is too much of a paradigm change to adopt without a desire to explore it.</p>
<p>For those with experience in more object oriented tooling, it will be more natural in my opinion than the quirks of bash scripts.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>With <code>ConvertFrom-Json</code> being such as magical tool, I&rsquo;ve been able to mix and match native tooling with PowerShell automagic cmdlets and get some great productive results.</p>
<h3 id="shell-customization" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#shell-customization" class="header-mark"></a>Shell Customization</h3><p>With my dotfiles managed by <a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chezmoi</a>, my terminal in any environment looks great as I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://starship.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starship</a></p>
<h2 id="apps" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#apps" class="header-mark"></a>Apps</h2><p>The ecosystem for nice dev tools feels better.
I bought <a href="/2020-06-24t160349-0000/" title="alfred microblog" rel="">Alfred Microblog Post</a> and <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dash</a> and find them really useful.</p>
<h2 id="verdict" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#verdict" class="header-mark"></a>Verdict</h2><p>So far, the experience has been one I&rsquo;d repeat.
For me, I&rsquo;ve actually accomplished more, and gotten aware from my desk more with the improved quality of the mobile experience and touchpad.</p>
<p>Would I do it again?
Currently yes.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>After digging through the mess of bash if comparison blocks, I found the PowerShell ternary operator very readable.
<code>(Test-Path $File -PathType Leaf) ? (Write-Host &quot;😀 Do something with positive match and process&quot;) : (Write-Host &quot;😢 Sad panda&quot;)</code>
Since all the bash tools are pretty much accessible from your <code>pwsh</code> prompt and scripts simply by being called, you gain all the perks of a clear readable scripting language, while still using native tooling.
It&rsquo;s not better than bash, just different.
For those experienced in bash and not really desiring to try something new, no problem!
For those looking to try something new, I think it&rsquo;s a great way to write a cross platform script, and a good default shell.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

        <p>Migrating from Windows 10 to macOS for professional use this week. So far the most painful things have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty rough experience getting displaylink to work, definitely not as plug-and-play as Windows.</li>
<li>Shortcuts! I&rsquo;m a serious shortcut fanatic. The difference in control/command/alt usage on on a mac is painful to my muscle memory and coding flow. Trying to not remap to windows based keys, but it&rsquo;s been hard.</li>
<li>Window management. I&rsquo;ve used divvy and tried some other&rsquo;s, but seriously, the lack of window snapping and aero peak is pretty glaring as a new user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, so far have most things up and running, and forced myself to do it through Ansible to learn something new. I now know I could setup my macbook 90% of the way in minutes with Ansible, so that&rsquo;s a win!</p>
