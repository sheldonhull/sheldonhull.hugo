# Go R1 Day 73


## progress

- I&#39;m more on day 90&#43; but haven&#39;t made the time to log it.
- Been working a ton with Mage and have some really cool work I&#39;ll be writing up soon, including using for health checks on projects, setup of core tooling, encoding credentials, and more. ðŸ’¯
- Also been working heavily on Go mono-repo module structure and some serverless based architecture tests that will make a fun write-up.
I&#39;m thinking of a demo of &#34;Disappointment as a Service&#34; with a lambda driven api for tracking disappointing events and returning something to help bring reality-checks to us all. ðŸ˜†

- I used a snippet from a blog today that allowed buffering stdout from go commands to capture and avoid streaming each line by wrapping up in a pterm spinner component.
Pretty neat!
