# Digital Garden Released


Split my blog into [notes.sheldonhull.com](https://notes.sheldonhull.com) for evergreen note taking and reference content.
I&#39;ll still maintain this blog for posts.

Mkdocs allows a minimal friction to publishing and previewing.
The directory structure is built automatically from directories.

While I love Hugo, it&#39;s more work to maintain small reference pages so I&#39;m going to split up my notes more like a &#34;digital garden&#34; approach.

- Free hosting through GitHub.
- 60 seconds from push to page refresh.

In comparison, Obsidian Publish and others can run $100&#43; a year.
