# Go R1 Day 21


## Day 21 of 100

## progress

- Signed up for exercism.io, which is a pretty great website to work through progressively harder exercises.
- Did [Hello world](https://exercism.io/tracks/go/exercises/hello-world/solutions/d63069aace8d42c7ac55ad9cea2f3a43) to start with as requires progressive steps through the exercises.
- Did a string concatenation exercise as well (Two Fer).

I like the mentor feedback system concept and submission of work.
After I finish this, would be good to add myself as a mentor and contribute back to this community.
This is a fantastic concept to help get acclimated to a new language and do progressively harder exercises to better learn the language usage.
