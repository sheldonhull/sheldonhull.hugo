# Ways to Improve Codespaces Local Docker Experience


I&#39;ve been enjoying Codespaces local development workflow with Docker containers.

I&#39;m using macOS and on Docker experimental release.
Here are some ideas to get started on improving the development experience.

- Clone the repository in the virtual volume (supported by the extension) to eliminate the binding between host and container.
This would entail working exclusively inside the container.
- Increased Docker allowed ram to 8GB from the default of 2GB.

Any other ideas? Add a comment (powered by GitHub issues, so it&#39;s just a GitHub issue in the backend)
