Visual Studio Code has a pretty great way to browse through themes by just selecting installed themes and using arrow keys to preview without apply. However, browsing those themes isn&#39;t quite so good, as you need to install to see the changes.

Ran across [Vscode Themes](https://vscodethemes.com/ https://bit.ly/2NHNsMW &#34;Vscode Themes&#34;) which provides a really nice experience if you feel like changing things up on your editor.
