# Go R1 Day 63


## progress

- Did some work on Go regex processing with a new linting tool concept I have for &#34;semantic line breaks&#34;.
- I&#39;ve forced myself to apply TDD from the get go, so it&#39;s been slow going initially to abstract my functions to be testable without being run as a CLI tool.
- Started on the run test for simulating the cli call as well.
