# Remove Chrome Autocomplete Suggestion


Do you have a Chrome suggestion for a domain, url, or specific site location that you don&#39;t want anymore?

You can remove an invalid suggestion that you don&#39;t want popping up each time by using `shift&#43;delete`.

If it&#39;s the first entry it will remove it, or use arrow keys to highlight a different entry and press the same command.
