# Go R1 Day 37


## progress

- initialized new start of cli tool to try to parse markdown content using Goldmark[^goldmark] and then convert markdown links into reference style links
- Improved default template for starting new basic cli tools with Go to include zerolog and run based design instead of the majority of logic being in main.
