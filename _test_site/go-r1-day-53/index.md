# Go R1 Day 53


## progress

- Troubleshooting on: `typechecking loop` that helped me learn a bit more on how the compiler parsing occurs.
Quick fix was to simply change `var logger *logger.Logger` to `var log *logger.Logger`.
- Read up on dependency injection concepts and clean architecture design.
