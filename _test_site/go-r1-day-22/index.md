# Go R1 Day 22


## Day 22 of 100

## progress

Using Dash, I read through much of the language specification.
Dry reading for sure, but helped a bit in understanding a little more on stuff like arrays, slices, loops, etc.

Nothing profound to add, except to say I don&#39;t think I want to write a language specification.
