# The Traditional Birthday Song Is Terrible


The traditional birthday song is terrible.It&#39;s never really changed.
It&#39;s like singing a dirge.
It&#39;s really really hard for people to sing anywhere close to on key.
We all sing it because we have to, but there is this feeling of regret, like &#34;I&#39;ll do it for you, but just because I love you&#34;.
It is followed by &#34;Many mourns&#34; by the closest available family clown.
Apparently, the roots were back in the 19th century, and wikipedia says:

&gt; In 1988, Warner/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for US$25 million, with the value of &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; estimated at US$5 million....In February 2016 Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, paving the way for the song to become public domain.[18] [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You)
&gt; Let&#39;s leave this tainted legacy behind. I propose a radical change.
&gt; Ditch it for something fun. Make a new family tradition.

This is much more like Rend Collective&#39;s reminder to be always practicing the Art of Celebration :-) It&#39;s super easy to sing the first time, promotes foot stomping and hand clapping, promotes dancing and jumping, and overall, I feel conveys the feeling a birthday should have.
New lyrics:

    **The Art of Celebration Birthday Song**
    - created after much deliberation and refinement in 1 min at the house of Sheldon Hull
    Hey hey hey, It&#39;s your birthday day
    Hey hey hey, It&#39;s your birthday day
    Hey hey hey, It&#39;s your birthday day
    Sing Loud, Sing Proud, It&#39;s Your Birthday
