        <h2 id="free-means-you-are-the-product" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#free-means-you-are-the-product" class="header-mark"></a>Free Means You Are the Product</h2><p>Over time, I&rsquo;ve begun to look at products that are free with more judgment.
The saying is: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s free, you are the product&rdquo;.
This often means your data and privacy are compromised as the product.</p>
<p>This has resulted in me looking more favorably at apps I would have dismissed in the past, such as <a href="https://leavemealone.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leave Me Alone</a>.</p>
<h2 id="leave-me-alone" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#leave-me-alone" class="header-mark"></a>Leave Me Alone</h2><p>The notion of buying credits for something I could script, click, or do myself made me use sporadically last year.
This year, I took the plunge and spent $10 and appreciate the concept and cost.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of tech interaction, you&rsquo;ll have a slew of newsletter and marketing subscriptions coming your way.
This noise can drown your email.</p>
<p>I saw one Children&rsquo;s clothing place that got my email on a receipt generate an average of 64 emails a month!</p>
<p>Leave Me Alone helps simplify the cleanup process by simplifying the summary of noisiest offenders, and one-click unsubscribes to any of these.</p>
<p>You can use an automatically generated rating based on ranked value on mailing lists, read engagement, number of emails sent monthly, and more.</p>
<p>Take a look, the free start is enough to figure out if you like it.</p>
<h2 id="other-tools" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#other-tools" class="header-mark"></a>Other Tools</h2><p>Combine this type of tool with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kill The Newsletter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inoreader (RSS Reader)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://subscriptionscore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subscription Score</a>: a really promising tool made by the same folks, but haven&rsquo;t added at this time as price seems a bit high for this specific feature if I&rsquo;m already using their app. (at this time $49 a year). Be nice if this was a feature provided automatically to those who bought 250 credits or more since it&rsquo;s powered by the data mining of lists users unsubscribe from the most.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be more likely to keep up to date with this noise reduced.
Last tip: Add GitHub Release notes like Terraform and others as a subscription in your RSS reader, and it might reduce the noise via email and slack on releases.</p>
