<p>There are a few .NET tools that until recently I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to work with as much, specifically ANTS Memory Profiler and ANTS Performance Profiler. The memory profiler is more useful for someone focused on memory leaks which a SQL Dev isn&rsquo;t as focused on for performance tuning. However, there are major benefits for diving into SQL Performance tuning with ANTS Performance profiler. I think I&rsquo;d say this tool makes the <em>epic</em> category of my #cooltools kit.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging processes for profiling activity is really identifying the single largest pain point. Trying to line up timings with the SQL plans and the application side by side is a big timesaver, and Red Gate improved ANTS Performance profiler to include the executed SQL with execution plans, making it a single stop to profile and get some useful information.</p>
<p>There are other ways to get useful information, such as running Brent Ozar&rsquo;s First Responder kit queries, Glenn Berry&rsquo;s diagnostic queries, Query Store, and more. These tend to focus on server performance. As someone working in software development, there is something to be said for the simplicity of running the application and profiling the .NET and SQL performance in one captured &amp; filtered result set. It&rsquo;s a pretty quick way to immediately reduce noise and view a complete performance picture of the application.</p>
<p>For performance profiling, Visual Studio has an option called Performance Profiler. I found my initial look at it to be positive, just really noisy.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: As a member of the Friends of Red Gate program, I get to try out all the cool Red Gate tools. Lucky me! This doesn&rsquo;t bias my reviews as I just like great tools that help me work with SQL server. This is one of them!</em></p>
<h2 id="profiling-net-app" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#profiling-net-app" class="header-mark"></a>Profiling .NET App</h2><!-- ![Setting up your profiling session](/images/profiling-net-app.png) Setting up your profiling session -->
<p>At the time of this articles publishing, there is no 2017 Visual studio extension which makes this process a few clicks less. For now, it still is simple. All you do is go to the bin/debug folder and select the executable you want to profile. Attaching to the .NET excecutable is required for my purpose, as attaching to an <em>existing process doesn&rsquo;t give you the ability to get all the SQL calls</em> which we definitely want.</p>
<h2 id="timeline--bookmarks" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#timeline--bookmarks" class="header-mark"></a>Timeline &amp; Bookmarks</h2><!-- ![timeline-bookmarks](/images/timeline-bookmarks.png) -->
<p>During the profiling you can perform actions with the application and create bookmarks of points in time as you are performing these actions to make it easier to compare and review results later.</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-results" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#reviewing-results" class="header-mark"></a>Reviewing Results</h2><!-- ![Call Tree View](/images/review-results.png) Call Tree View -->
<p>This is based on the call tree. It shows code calls, and is a great way to be the database guy that says&hellip; &ldquo;hey SQL server isn&rsquo;t slow, it&rsquo;s your code&rdquo; :-)</p>
<h2 id="database-calls" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#database-calls" class="header-mark"></a>Database Calls</h2><!-- ![Database Calls](/images/database-calls.png) Database Calls -->
<p>The database calls are my favorite part of this tool. This integration is very powerful and lets you immediately trim down to the calls made with timings and associated executed sql text. RG even went and helped us out by providing an execution plan viewer! When I first saw this I fell in love. Having had no previous experience with Entity framework of other ORMs, I found the insight into the performance and behavior of the application to be tremendously helpful the first time I launched this.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-html-report" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#exporting-html-report" class="header-mark"></a>Exporting HTML Report</h2><!-- ![HTML Exported Report](/images/ants-html-exported-report.png) HTML Exported Report -->
<p>A benefit for summarizing some action for others to consume is the ability to select the entire timeline, or narrow to a slide of time, and export the results as a HTML report.</p>
<p>This was pretty helpful as it could easily provide a way to identify immediate pain points in a daily performance testing process and focus effort on the highest cost application actions, as well as database calls.</p>
<h2 id="automation-in-profiling" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#automation-in-profiling" class="header-mark"></a>Automation in Profiling</h2><p>RG Documentation shows great flexibility for the profiler being call from command line. I see a lot of potential benefit here if you want to launch a few actions systematically from your application and establish a normal performance baseline and review this report for new performance issues that seem to be arising.</p>
<p>I generated some reports automatically by launching my executable via command line, profiling, and once this was completed, I was provided with a nice formatted HTML report for the calls. At the time of this article, I couldn&rsquo;t find any call for generating the SQL calls as their own report.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sheldonhull/8055f44fd25af7d010ba22c6e54692e4.js"></script>

<h2 id="tldr" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#tldr" class="header-mark"></a>TL;DR</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Incredibly powerful way to truly get a picture into an application&rsquo;s activity and the true pain points in performance it is experiencing. It truly helps answer the question very quickly of what is the area that needs the most attention.</li>
<li>Very streamlined way to get a summary of the SQL activity an application is generating and the associated statements and execution plans for further analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>At times, with larger amounts of profiled data the application could feel unresponsive. Maybe separating some of the panes activity into asynchronous loads with progress indicators would make this feel better.</li>
</ol>
<p>** Neutral/Wishlist **</p>
<ol>
<li>More an observation than complaint, but I sure would like to see some active work being released on this with more functionality and SQL performance tuning focus. Seems to be stable and in maintenance mode rather than major enhancements being released. For those involved in software development, this tool is a powerful utility and I&rsquo;d love to see more improvements being released on it. RedGate&hellip; hint hint? :-)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to see even more automation focus, with the option of preset Powershell cmdlets, and team foundation server task integration to help identify changes in performance patterns when scaled up. Leveraging this to help baseline application performance overall and report and develop trends against this might help catch issues that crop up more quickly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="additional-info-on-more-profiling-focused-apps" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#additional-info-on-more-profiling-focused-apps" class="header-mark"></a>additional info on more profiling focused apps</h2><p>Since the material is related, I thought I&rsquo;d mention a few tools I&rsquo;ve used to help profile activity, that is not focused on a wholistic performance analysis, and more about activity.</p>
<ol>
<li>For more &ldquo;profiling&rdquo; and less performance analysis my favorite SQL profiling tool Devart&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/event-profiler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DbForge Sql Profiler</a> uses extended events and while amazing, isn&rsquo;t as focused a tool for app and SQL performance analysis. If you haven&rsquo;t checked that tool (free!) out I highly recommend it vs running profiler. It uses extended events and provides a nice experience in profiling and reviewing results. Super easy to use and very flexible for filtering/sorting/exporting. The only issues I have with it are the filtering setup is annoying, but tolerable to work with, and no execution plans that I&rsquo;ve been able to find built in, unlike running extended events in SSMS directly. Hopefully, Devart will recognize what an awesome tool they&rsquo;ve made and continue to push it forward.</li>
<li>For just getting Entity framework and other ADO.net calls you can use intellitrace with the option for ADO.NET tracing enabled. I found this nice, but a little clunky to use compared to Linq Insight or other options mentioned. It&rsquo;s included with visual studio so if only using periodically then this would be ok to work with.</li>
<li>For a cleaner implementation of Entity Framework Profiling than the Intellitrace route use <a href="http://bit.ly/2vo2Zaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devarts dbForge Linq Insight</a> (I love this tool for cleaner profiling of ADO.NET activity when you aren&rsquo;t focused on overall performance of the application) and are working in Visual studio.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all else fails&hellip; you can always succumb to dark side and just use SQL Profiler or worse yet&hellip;SSMS activity monitor :-)</p>

        <p>Note this was during earlier beta usage, so some of the UI and other features will have been updated more. I plan on writing more on this promising tool as  I get a chance to dive into it more, especially the powershell cmdlets for database cloning automation. In the meantime, I believe the permissions issue is still relevant, so I&rsquo;ll post this as a reminder in case someone is working through the initial setup.</p>
<p>It seems like a real promising toolkit for testing and reducing storage requirements for testing database automated deployment pipelines.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t using for a while due to error message I couldn&rsquo;t figure out. I then read through the help documentation again and found that the permissions required for the service account should be a <strong>local admin</strong>. Once I added the service account to local admins, it correctly allowed the service to start.</p>

        <p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen much talk on doing data comparisons on temporal tables, as they are a new feature. I went through the exercise to compare current to historical to see how Red Gate &amp; Devart handled this. I&rsquo;m a part of the Friends of Red Gate program, so love checking out their latest updates, and I&rsquo;m also a regular tester on Devart which also provides fantastic tools. Both handled Temporal Tables with aplomb, so here&rsquo;s a quick walk through on how I did this.</p>
<h2 id="ssms-2016-view-of-temporal-table" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#ssms-2016-view-of-temporal-table" class="header-mark"></a>SSMS 2016 View Of Temporal Table</h2><div

<p>With the latest version of SSMS, you can see the temporal tables labeled and expanded underneath the source table.</p>

    <a href="#red-gate-sql-data-compare-12" class="header-mark"></a>Red Gate SQL Data Compare 12</h2><p>To begin the comparison process, you need to do some custom mapping, which requires navigating into the Tables &amp; Views settings in SQL Data Compare</p>
<h3 id="unmap-the-existing-options" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#unmap-the-existing-options" class="header-mark"></a>Unmap the existing options</h3><p>To remap the Customers to Customers_Archive, we need to select this in the tables and choose to unmap the Customer and the Customer-Archive Tables from each other. This is 2 unmapping operations.</p>
<h3 id="setup-compare-key" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#setup-compare-key" class="header-mark"></a>Setup Compare Key</h3><p>Go into the comparison settings on the table now and designate the key as the value to compare against.

<h3 id="compare-results" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#compare-results" class="header-mark"></a>Compare results</h3><p>If you run into no results coming back, look to turn off the setting in compare options for Checksum comparison, which helps improve the initial compare performance.

<h3 id="diff-report" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#diff-report" class="header-mark"></a>Diff Report</h3><p>Both tools report differences. RG&rsquo;s tool has focused on the diff report being simple CSV output. This is fine in the majority of cases, though I&rsquo;m hoping for additional XLSX and HTML diff reports similar to DbForge eventually. In the case of the CSV output, you could consume the information easily in Power-BI, Excel, or even&hellip; SQL Server :-) No screenshot on this as it&rsquo;s just a csv output.</p>
<h2 id="devart-sql-data-compare" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#devart-sql-data-compare" class="header-mark"></a>Devart SQL Data Compare</h2><p>Going into the mapping, you can see support for Customers and Customers_Archive, which is the temporal history table for this.

        <p>I had some cross database comparisons that I wanted to simplify, but ensuring the collation matched. The amount of objects that I would have had to drop and recreate was a bit daunting, so I looked for a way to migrate the database to a different collation.Using the Red Gate toolkit, I was able to achieve this pretty quickly. There are other methods with copying data built in to SSMS that could do some of these steps, but the seamless approach was really nice with the SQL Toolbelt.</p>
<ol>
<li>First I created the database with the collation I wanted to match using SQL Compare 12.</li>
<li>I deployed the original schema to the new location.</li>
<li>Ran SQL Data Compare 12 and migrated all the data to the new database.
Since the new database was created with the desired migration, I was good to go!</li>
</ol>

        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t explored the visual color coding of tabs based on pattern matches with SQL Prompt, I&rsquo;d suggest you check this out. Earlier iterations of Red Gate&rsquo;s SQL Prompt did not change tab color immediately when the connection was changed. Red Gate&rsquo;s tab color could get out of sync occasionally, so I stopped depending on it.</p>
<p>Apparently this has been improved on and my testing now shows that the tab recoloring for connections is changing when the connection is updated immediately. This is a great visual indicator of what your query window is connected to.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/2016-05-04_12-06-49.png" title="Recolor Tab with SQL Prompt" data-thumbnail="/images/2016-05-04_12-06-49.png">

    </a></figure></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a fan of SSMSBoost combined with SQLPrompt, but I&rsquo;m finding myself needing less addins as SQLPrompt has been enhanced. The ease of configuration and setup is a major factor as well.
SSMSboost Preferred connections are great for when needing to quickly context switch between different connections in the same window (and sync with object explorer)</p>

<li>I think that SQLPrompt would have some great productivity enhancements by implementing something similar to SSMSBoost preferred connections. <a href="http://bit.ly/2bisJyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a UserVoice item on it. Add your vote</a></li>
<li>SQLPrompt enhancements to synchronize object explorer connections based on the current query window would be another great option. <a href="http://bit.ly/2birZJZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I created a user voice item on this here.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m finding myself depending on SQLPrompt more. As a member in the Friend of Redgate program, I&rsquo;ve had access to try some of the new beta versions and find the team extremely responsive.</p>

        <h4 id="command-line-install-options" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#command-line-install-options" class="header-mark"></a>command line install options</h4><p>ReadyRoll has some great features, including the ability to use without cost on a build server. If you want to ease setup on multiple build servers you could create a simple command line install step against the EXE.</p>
<h4 id="future-changes" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#future-changes" class="header-mark"></a>future changes</h4><p>ReadyRoll was recently acquired by Redgate, so the installer options may change in the future to be more inline with the standard Redgate installer. For now, this is a way to automate an install/updates.</p>
<h4 id="autoupdating-via-ketarin" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#autoupdating-via-ketarin" class="header-mark"></a>autoupdating via Ketarin</h4><p>I personally use Ketarin to help me manage automatically updating apps like SQL Server Management Studio. I&rsquo;ve uploaded a public entry for ReadyRoll to automate download and install of the latest ReadyRoll version when available. For more detail on how to use Ketarin see my earlier post on <a href="/automating-ssms-2016-updates--install/" rel="">Automating SSMS Upgrades</a></p>

        <p>Looks like the rapid release channel now has a great feature for locking database objects that you are working on. Having worked in a shared environment before, this could have been a major help. It&rsquo;s like the poor man&rsquo;s version of checking an object out in visual studio except on database objects! With multiple developers working in a shared environment, this might help reduce conflicting multiple changes on the same object.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn&rsquo;t look to evaluate dependency chains, so there is always the risk of a dependent object being impacted. I think though that this has some promise, and is a great improvement for shared environment SQL development that uses source control.</p>
