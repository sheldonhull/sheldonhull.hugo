        <h2 id="exploring-mont-saint-michel" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#exploring-mont-saint-michel" class="header-mark"></a>Exploring Mont Saint-Michel</h2><p>We set off in the car to explore Saint Mont Michel.
After a beautiful cruise in the rental at 130kph, we arrived.
The parking lot was huge, reminding me of a smaller version of a Six Flag Over Texas.
A single bus picked us up and took us to the site.
This bus is one of maybe 2 actively in rotation, with a max capacity of 68.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine how insane this journey would have been during peak season.
There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d recommend it during a busy period.</p>
<p>Since we went during off season this was probably one of my favorite places I&rsquo;ve visited so far.</p>
<p>As you arrive, the stark contrast of the surrounding sand and water with the tightly overlapping walls of the structure makes it stand out even more.
Unlike many castles and sites situated on prominent mounts or hills, it&rsquo;s alone.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, we immediately ventured into the sands, enjoying the view from the outside, my favorite perspective.
Ascending into it, the commercialization was apparent with trinkets and souvenir stores lining the walkway.
Rick Steves notes this is not new, as medieval times also saw similar commercial activities, so I guess we always love our trinkets!</p>
<p>Karsten got into taking some pictures, which I&rsquo;ll include as well.</p>
<h2 id="normandy-american-cemetery" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#normandy-american-cemetery" class="header-mark"></a>Normandy American Cemetery</h2><p>This was another highlight.</p>
<p>The quiet respect shown here was peaceful.
The coast was stunning in the sunset.</p>
<p>I took my time walking around and as I thought of amount of death this represented and that it was a small portion of the loss of life, I felt impacted emotionally.</p>
<p>The rows of crosses represented husbands, sons, and fathers.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
That it was but a fraction of the loss of lives from the concentration camps was a bit hard to absorb.</p>
<p>This is a place anyone traveling to Normandy as an American should visit.
The location was immaculately maintained.
I learned that there is a special agency in our government, the ABMC: American Battle Monuments Commission that maintains these.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-french-roads-priorité-à-droite" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#navigating-french-roads-priorit%c3%a9-%c3%a0-droite" class="header-mark"></a>Navigating French Roads: Priorité à Droite</h2><p>Something else that intrigued me was the inconsistency with the French driving rule, Priorité à Droite, which dictates always yielding to the right.
Although it&rsquo;s a fundamental rule, I rarely encountered it.
I was a bit nervous driving in Europe for the first time and kept worrying about this one specific rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so atypical from what I&rsquo;m used to, I kept thinking I&rsquo;d t-bone someone.</p>
<p>What I discovered is that it&rsquo;s the default rule except where marked otherwise.</p>
<p>In other words&hellip; the right hand vehicle gets priority except for:</p>
<p>🚩 There are lane markings or sigange for them indicating</p>
<p>🚩 stop lights</p>
<p>🚩 a specific yellow diamond sign up the road indicating priority road</p>
<p>🚩 a special roundabout sign indicating to yield</p>
<p>In other words, I probably ran past this situation without realizing it on a country road and otherwise, it was normal driving.
Seems like a terrible rule, considering it&rsquo;s overridden so much that the benefit of not having to put signs in rural places results in a lot of guessing if you have priority in all other places.</p>
<h2 id="a-day-at-versailles" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#a-day-at-versailles" class="header-mark"></a>A Day at Versailles</h2><p>We returned to our temporary home in Paris, and the next day, Sunday, we traveled to the Palace of Versailles.
As a digital nomad, making the most of the weekends is key.
A month as a digital nomad can afford me roughly 6 days of free time if I use the weekends to the max.</p>
<p>The palace, a monument to excess, was overwhelming.
The crowds in the rooms were intense, and as I shuffled for 15 minutes elbow to elbow with crowds, it was hard for me to enjoy the rooms.
The gardens were a highlight, offering about 30 minutes of enjoyment before night closure.</p>
<p>The palace&rsquo;s grandeur seemed like a tribute to nobility, wealth, and power.
These are all things I don&rsquo;t value much, so I found very little to wow me with its garishness.
A few of the halls were cleaner and less Baroque, and in those areas I did enjoy the general feel more, with black and white tiled floors and marble sculptures.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina.
A tribute to the wealth of a family who had it all speaks far less to me than the other sites we&rsquo;ve seen.
In comparison, I found the Louvre&rsquo;s sculptures more impactful than the palace&rsquo;s opulence.</p>

<h2 id="karstens-post" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#karstens-post" class="header-mark"></a>Karsten&rsquo;s Post</h2><p>Karsten provided me with his perspective&hellip;</p>
<p>So today, my family and I went to Versailles.
There was a long line initially, but thankfully, that was the wrong one.
We found a much shorter line, which was a relief even though we were a bit late.
The journey involved an hour-long train ride, followed by a 12-minute walk to the B line.
Then, we hopped onto line C, which had 13 stops, roughly a half-hour ride.</p>
<p>Once there, our first stop, after a necessary bathroom break, was King Louis XIV&rsquo;s room, well, more accurately, rooms.
After navigating through what seemed like a bajillion of them, we arrived at the Hall of Mirrors.
This stunning hallway connects his suite to the queen&rsquo;s suite.</p>
<p>Post this royal expedition, we attempted to dine at a creperie called La Place, but it was fully occupied, so no luck there.
Instead, we found another spot, the name of which escapes me at the moment, sorry!
This place had a relaxing atmosphere and served some pretty good crepes at remarkably cheap prices, a large crepe for just 4 euros!</p>
<p>After our meal, we strolled back to the gardens, which were free to enter.
While the girls played, I managed to snap some good photos and even shot some decent videos, despite the freezing cold.
It was a nice way to expend some energy.
Finally, we began our journey back.</p>
<p>We took the C line to Châtelet-Les Halles, then switched to the D line.
Two stops later, we arrived at Stade de France, followed by a short 5-minute walk back home.
And that&rsquo;s where we are now.</p>

        <![CDATA[
        
        
        
            
        
        <h2 id="a-trip-to-the-bakery" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#a-trip-to-the-bakery" class="header-mark"></a>A Trip to the Bakery</h2><p>Today, I took Karis out for a bit of spontaneity.
We decided to go down to Copains, a bakery about 30 minutes away, taking the D train followed by Metro 2. As we walked up the idyllic streets, wet with Paris rain, Copains stood out, bright and cheerful in contrast to the surrounding shops.
Its layout was beautiful, reminding me of a minimalist, modern style with plenty of space that could have been used for café tables, but was instead just empty.
A mosaic-style ceiling gave the impression of a small cathedral.</p>
<p>The two people sitting at the only available seats saw Karis and me, saw our desire to sit and order something, and gracefully gave up their seats, giving us a wonderful opportunity to sit.
As we perused the selection, we found that the apple-based treat and her chocolate croissant were some of the best we&rsquo;ve ever had.
They were delicious, flaky, light, and fluffy, not at all like typical gluten-free food.
In fact, if this hadn&rsquo;t been a dedicated gluten-free bakery, I would have seriously doubted that what I was eating was gluten-free.</p>
<p>We sat and enjoyed our meal, Karis wearing a whipped cream mustache and enjoying a hot chocolate with a shot of coffee.
The staff were welcoming and a little enthusiastic in encouraging us to stock up as much as possible.
There was great value in the purchases, as we ended up with a whole bag full of items for only 70 euros.
In contrast, I think one of the other local gluten-free bakeries would have been almost double the price.</p>
<h2 id="an-obscura-detour" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#an-obscura-detour" class="header-mark"></a>An Obscura Detour</h2><p>As we exited and started to head back, I decided to look at Atlas Obscura.
Atlas Obscura is an app that shows odd and unique places to visit.
This appeals to me since I don&rsquo;t like typical tourist attractions and want to find odd and unique, interesting things in the area.
So we started our journey, a bit of improvised exploration, and decided to walk up towards a statue and the Wall of Love.
The Wall of Love was closed or blocked off and unable to be visited, from what I could see.
Signs about keeping your trash in the right bins to dissuade the Paris rats always caught my attention.
As we continued to walk, we decided to go towards a statue where a man half emerges from a wall.</p>
<h2 id="its-kinda-hard-to-miss" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#its-kinda-hard-to-miss" class="header-mark"></a>It&rsquo;s Kinda Hard to Miss</h2><p>I got a little turned around, and as we looked for any other sites before heading home, I noticed a beautiful church right around the corner.
It turns out that the Basilica was only 500 feet away, pretty hard to miss.
So I said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s live a little, explore this Saturday night,&rdquo; and went with Karis to the Basilica.
As we arrived, we saw a huge line, which immediately dissuaded me, until I saw them letting a batch of people in.
I believe they had been holding up for a service.</p>
<h2 id="the-sacré-cœur-basilica" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-sacr%c3%a9-c%c5%93ur-basilica" class="header-mark"></a>The Sacré-Cœur Basilica</h2><p>We only needed to wait five minutes and went in, and it was beautiful.
At first, I thought it was a recording, but it turns out that the voices I was hearing were actually the priest and some nuns singing a beautiful song that echoed throughout the room.
The scale is really hard to visualize, even with the video I&rsquo;ve taken.
You feel dwarfed in that room where the ceiling feels 100 feet high, and once you go to the center of the room and you look up, the dome of the basilica rises so far above you that it&rsquo;s daunting.
The Basilica&rsquo;s height is over 200 meters above the site Sacré-Cœur Basilica, Sacred Heart of Montmartre, often simply Sacré-Cœur.
It&rsquo;s dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the facts related to it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Apparently, the plan to build the church was started on September 4th, 1870.
Interestingly enough, in reading Wikipedia, construction costs estimated at 7 million francs were expended before any above-ground structure became visible.
Also interesting was that it was not named a historical monument until 2022.
The total height of the dome is over 270 feet.</p>
<p>This is pretty amazing, and inside the place, you can hear the murmur of voices and steps, but there is a reverence by all the people sitting.
There&rsquo;s a separation from the people traveling through it on the sides, who are asked to be quiet, from the people in the middle.
They ask not to take pictures in the middle section to respect and honor people who are in prayer.
As Karis and I went through, we stopped near the side, took a few pictures, and sat and talked about the building as well as lifted up a prayer for her grandparents, or rather great-grandparents, bringing a blessing on them.</p>
<h2 id="does-a-cathedral-impress-god" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#does-a-cathedral-impress-god" class="header-mark"></a>Does a Cathedral Impress God?</h2><p>One thing I found interesting as I discussed with her was the concept of what pleases God.
She asked if God was pleased or impressed by this type of building, and I said to her,  &lsquo;While this may be impressive to us, this is but a speck, just dust to God.
Instead, what God cares about, if we look at First Corinthians, we can recall that all of this is but a clanging symbol, noise, or dust to God if it is not filled with love.&rsquo;
So I said, It&rsquo;s really about the people.
If people come here and they aren&rsquo;t letting God change their life and be a light in the world, and it&rsquo;s merely a formality of religion.
Without the relationship and without action of love towards the people in the community and around them, then this place, as impressive as it seems to us, is just but a noise to God.
However, if the people here are using this as a place of worship and then taking that out into the world, then this can be a place that helps us draw closer to God and inspires a sense of reverence.&quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that the artistry of the people, the creativity of its builders, is something we should value.</p>
<p>However, as a religious monument, it&rsquo;s important to understand that God is not impressed by man&rsquo;s creation.
While it may help instill a sense of reverence in us, the love and action towards our fellow man is what our faith is derived from.
God could care less whether we are in a park, a tent, a hovel, a ministry full of drug addicts reaching out for Jesus, or the most beautiful basilica in Europe.
What matters is the hearts turned in reverence and adoration to Him.</p>
<p>We enjoyed this time as we prayed, and we left.
As we left, we took plenty of pictures and video.</p>
<p>Karis got an extra point in the imaginary game we&rsquo;ve been having since she watched and found a rat just sitting out, brazen in the middle of some grass behind a fence, chowing down on somebody&rsquo;s thrown away meal.</p>
<h2 id="lots-of-stairs" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#lots-of-stairs" class="header-mark"></a>Lots of Stairs</h2><p>We continued walking and enjoyed the steps that reminded me of the movie John Wick.
The massive amount of steps to get up to this area were beautiful.
We did forget to go down the train that goes up and down the hill, so we took the stairs and enjoyed our walk down.</p>
<h2 id="back-home" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#back-home" class="header-mark"></a>Back Home</h2><p>We jumped on the subway and enjoyed the ride home.
It was a bit packed and sweltering for a bit due to train issues, even in some cases the train doors not opening, but we finally made it back as Karis collapsed with joy to play a little bit of Minecraft.
Overall, I figure that was a successful outing for an unplanned, spontaneous Paris adventure.</p>

<li>This was a fun test case of a few technologies.</li>
<li>Use Voice Memo to record the experience that evening when I got home.</li>
<li>Told ChatGPT to process the audio, failed, which is why I used Google.</li>
<li>Uploaded the voice memo to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&rsquo;s Speech-To-Text</a> in the Google Cloud developer console.</li>
<li>Downloaded transcript and told ChatGPT to preserve my original content, except to remove filler words, improve unclear statements, and grammatical issues, maintaining original content otherwise.</li>
<li>Had it generate a title, metadata summary so I didn&rsquo;t have to think about it.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
<p>If I plugged in a custom app that used Google Speech to Text (which also leverages machine learning), then I could see it as a useful way to audio journal and still post.
Why didn&rsquo;t I use the &ldquo;audio mode in ChatGPT app&rdquo;?
If I could have it wait for a keyword it would be great.
I took 15 mins with lots of gaps and I told the story.
The way the current app works would essentially only let me pause for 3 seconds before submitting.
This can result in using up your throttling limit as you keep going back and forth.
I hope the audio-mode can improve to better let pauses for transcript take place, and then I&rsquo;d just use it directly.</p>

        An Unexpected Supporter of the Paris Sanitation System

        <p>Somtimes you feel that you&rsquo;ve done things right as a parent, even when things go awry.
There we were at the park, kids needing a restroom break.
Inside, I find no toilet paper, everything broken down, a poor public restroom experience.</p>
<p>Coming out, I see my family on the steps of this Parisian public edifice.
I comment on the bathroom&rsquo;s state.</p>

<div class="conversation-card">
  
  
    
      <p></p>
    
  
    
      
      
      
      
        
      
      
        <div class="dialogue left">
          <strong>Me</strong>:
          They were gross. No toilet paper.
        </div>
      
    
  
    
      
      
      
      
      
        <div class="dialogue right">
          <strong>Karis</strong>:
          Thankfully, mom gave me a baby wipe.
        </div>
      
    
  
    
      
      
      
      
      
        <div class="dialogue left">
          <strong>Me</strong>:
          You didn&rsquo;t try to flush it, right? They can clog the sewer system.
        </div>
      
    
  
    
      
      
      
      
      
        <div class="dialogue right">
          <strong>Karis</strong>:
          Oh no, I threw it in the trash, but first, it fell into the toilet water, and I had to fish it out.
        </div>
      
    
  
    
      
      
      
      
      
        <div class="dialogue left">
          <strong>Me</strong>:
          You did what?!
        </div>
      
    
  
    
      
      
      
      
      
        <div class="dialogue right">
          <strong>Karis</strong>:
          Yeah, I know about the sewer system, so I made sure to fish it out&hellip;with my hands. It was so gross.
        </div>
      
    
  
    
      <p></p>
    
  
</div>

<p>We all laughed. It&rsquo;s reassuring to know my daughter advocates for Paris&rsquo; sanitation system more than any tourist probably ever has.
After an extra amount of hand santizer, we moved on.</p>

        <p>Acted like I wasn&rsquo;t going to go to work today with my 4 year old daughter.
She looked over at me and told me I don&rsquo;t have to go somewhere, I just walk up the stairs.
&ldquo;Your boss will want you to go to work today&rdquo;.
Very astitute, I observed.</p>
<p>But what do I do when I go to work?
Do I fix cars, construction, or other things?</p>
<p>She looked at at me and said I put on my headset and talk to people about important stuff.</p>
<p>No cool computer hacker cred for me today.</p>

She held up her hands and said: &ldquo;Five&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that as a win considering that&rsquo;s all the fingers on that hand. 😂</p>

        <p>My morning. Explaining set and intersect theory basics to my 10 year old with Minecraft gamer tags.
Trying to justify the need to know this, the best I could come up with was his future need to build a shark attack report accurately.</p>
<p>Kids are the best. Tech is fun. What job would have me spin up with <code>docker-compose up -d</code> my MSSQL container, write a quick SQL example with <code>INTERSECT</code>, <code>UNION</code> and all to demonstrate this magic.</p>
<p>Followed it up with a half-hearted lie that my day is comprised of <code>cmatrix</code> 😂  which he didn&rsquo;t believe for more than a couple seconds.</p>
