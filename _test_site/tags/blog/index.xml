        <![CDATA[
        
        
        
            
        
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a bit from the first week.
We were pretty exhausted from jet lag so I&rsquo;ve delayed posting, but figured better something now than to keep on delaying.
Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="kids-entries" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#kids-entries" class="header-mark"></a>Kids Entries</h2><hr/>
<p><strong>Karis&rsquo; Entry</strong>: We went to a bakery the first full day here in Paris, France.
After the bakery, we enjoyed our food at a park.
I had a delicious glazed croissant chocolate.
Then, as if on cue, a double rainbow appeared.
It was amazing - the new double rainbow people!
At a bus stop, I caught my first glimpse of the Eiffel Tower, that amazing landmark.
We got closer, went around it, and let me tell you, it was amazing.
We saw the Eiffel Tower from the top, and I got it all on the GoPro, but everything looks tiny through it, still it was cool.
Then as it got dark and the lights went on, the Eiffel Tower became ten times more amazing, all sparkly and bright.
Later at a bridge - not the most famous but still famous, and a beautiful carousel nearby - we didn&rsquo;t go on, but it sure was fun to look at.
My mom took lots of pictures.
But yeah, Jasper the cat was there when we got back at like 6 or 7 pm, and he&rsquo;s just the best, he&rsquo;s my new stuffy.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Ella&rsquo;s Entry</strong>: There were more than ten parakeets outside our window this morning!
Then last night, we went to the Gellato Shop - a different one than before.
Oh, and we also went to a park dad stopped at for a few minutes on our walk home, at night.
They had ropes and a big net.
Climbed it like there was no tomorrow.
Saw another rat.
And there was this trash can while we were walking and out of nowhere, a whole bunch of rats scurried off, yuck!
I have a new stuffy bat.
That&rsquo;s all for me.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Karsten&rsquo;s Entry</strong>: So, about today&hellip; We went shopping and saw the Arc de Triomphe, not necessarily in that order.
And I&rsquo;ve got something to say about the subway here - I&rsquo;ve been learning to navigate it.
Oh, and by the way, my dad&rsquo;s bad at it.
He&rsquo;s the worst with directions.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="navigating" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#navigating" class="header-mark"></a>Navigating</h2><p><strong>Sheldon&rsquo;s Entry</strong>: The stress from our journey&rsquo;s beginning is fading, and the challenges we&rsquo;ve faced together have brought us closer.
Mastering foreign metro routes together stretched our comfort zones but boosted our confidence.
Seeing Karsten navigate crowded subway stations with ease was gratifying.</p>
<h2 id="ai" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#ai" class="header-mark"></a>AI</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with ChatGPT-4, and its image recognition for translations is awesome.
It&rsquo;s been super helpful with everything from understanding ventilation systems to deciphering mixed-language menus.
When Karsten asked about options without meat, the previously translated menu was used as the source and ChatGippity filtered the choices from a photo of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="language" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#language" class="header-mark"></a>Language</h2><p>This whole experience is giving me a new perspective on what folks moving to an unfamiliar country might go through, with a place not using their primary language.
It&rsquo;s an odd experience to not have my known language spoken commonly.
I&rsquo;m less chatty here, partly because small talk feels more awkward, and partly because people respect personal space differently.</p>
<h2 id="privacy--personal-space" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#privacy--personal-space" class="header-mark"></a>Privacy &amp; Personal Space</h2><p>Here, privacy is about respecting boundaries, not just physical distance.
It&rsquo;s quite different from Texas, where even a slight bump might lead to a chat.
In France, you could be elbow-to-elbow with someone in a cafe and not say a word, and that&rsquo;s totally normal.
I&rsquo;ve noticed that here, privacy is valued regardless of how close you physically are to others, which is a stark contrast to the space-equals-privacy mindset back in Texas.
Getting used to crowded subways, something I&rsquo;d usually avoid has been a challenge.
It&rsquo;s like New York in that sense.
But watching my family adapt so quickly to these new norms has been amazing - they&rsquo;re doing great!</p>
<p>The first time I packed my entire family into a subway car that had no room it was a difficult thing, as my tendency was to &ldquo;wait for the next subway&rdquo;, as I&rsquo;m averse to that level of crowds.
It&rsquo;s just the way things are here (and in places like New York).</p>
<h2 id="put-another-shrimp-on-the-barbie" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#put-another-shrimp-on-the-barbie" class="header-mark"></a>Put Another Shrimp on the Barbie</h2><p>On our journey down from the Eiffel Tower, I met some folks from Australia, and felt kinda silly being excited to hear someone speaking English&hellip; thinking &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my people&rdquo;&hellip; I mean seriously, they are from Australia.</p>
<p>Not exactly Texas. 🤣</p>
<p>The most pressing thought as I traveled down the stair stepper from Hell (aka Eiffel Tower), was: &ldquo;If the Eiffel Tower was translated to London or Syndey, would we all be going down on the left side instead of the right, and walk on the left of the sidewalk instead of the right?&rdquo;.
I know I know&hellip; important things.</p>
<p>Thankfully my suspicion was correct.
Those good folks told me that yes, it&rsquo;s the opposite and it does take a bit of getting used to when it&rsquo;s engrained in your muscle memory.</p>
<p>I told Sarah later that I wish I&rsquo;d been witty enough to reverse the &ldquo;Dumb and Dumber&rdquo; joke about mixing up Austria and Australia and asked them if they made the best Vienna sausage in their country.
Yeah, I know it&rsquo;s stupid, but I can&rsquo;t help what goes this this brain sometimes.</p>

</div>

<p>Fun fact, they did know about one of my favorite Australians, Tim Minchin.
I said, he&rsquo;s a comedy singer, can&rsquo;t remember his name at the moment, but reminds me of Johnny Depp, and they got it immediately. 🤣</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll do some video later as I get the time (the internet is painfully slow at this location).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Database Developer, Production DBA, Cloud Engineer, and other odd hats.</p>
<p>Some of my perspectives is different from the roles I&rsquo;ve been involved in.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="agree-" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#agree-" class="header-mark"></a>Agree 👍</h2><blockquote>
<p>If I&rsquo;m awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree you fix it!
I believe in continual refactoring and improvement, applying Site Reliability Engineering principles.
Don&rsquo;t kick the can down the street.
Own it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agree, it&rsquo;s a solid start and often can be done if you are working in a non-engineer role to bring value immediately to your company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A caveat: a company should invest in the development of their employees, so try to leverage those benefits first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it&rsquo;s time to move on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is a routine occurrence, heck yes.
Sometimes you can&rsquo;t help but run into politics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour. I&rsquo;d rather spend time with kids, family, or friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.
On this topic, companies shouldn&rsquo;t schedule team/company events in employees&rsquo; off time.
Schedule it during work hours.
Don&rsquo;t impact their family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault. You better believe I would&rsquo;ve walked over fire for her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% agree. My first week at one of my roles, I broke internalization and required the team to deploy a hotfix to clients overseas.
Release manager protected me during calls and said we had a fix in place. No blame.
I stayed 7 years and would have done almost anything for that release manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**** those devops guys and gals are**** smart. At least those mofos get paid though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>😊 We are making it up just like anyone else, but have to have flexibility in learning and change due to the wide range of things to learn.
Despite focusing on a role in Backend Engineering now, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to have worked in a Development Operations team and see growth with my ability to handle pressure, cross-functional communication, and wide range of technology exposure.</p>
<p>AWS is hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows. Why? Because I eventually worked in Linux. So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True. I wish I had started early.
There is a career in purely Windows-based development, but I&rsquo;d tell anyone starting out, it&rsquo;s better to start with Linux as a choice if possible.
It feels so much simpler overall than Windows with all its API-based management, registry, and lots of complexity overall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I siked myself out for so long.
Linux feels natural as I&rsquo;m immersed in it more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.
My inner geek want to play with ML.
My engineer side questions the value for ML in normal enterprise work.
It brings value, but I&rsquo;d lean towards thinking the majority of businesses not specifically doing large amounts of analytics as a core business aren&rsquo;t going to find quick value from the magic 8 ball.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/machine-learning-is-a-marvelously-executed-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Is A Marvelously Executed Scam</a></p>
<h2 id="disagree-" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#disagree-" class="header-mark"></a>Disagree 👎</h2><blockquote>
<p>When I first started, I was enamored with technology and programming and computer science. I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still love tech.
I think the tendency to tinker and experiment is just in my dna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish this was true.
In my experience, the documentation I&rsquo;ve written hasn&rsquo;t brought the value and recognization I thought it would, if the culture doesn&rsquo;t prize this.</p>
<p>I still write &amp; blog, but unless the work culture supports reading first then meeting on something, I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s not given the priority it deserves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. ****, I said it. Fight me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started with dynamic languages.
Having started with Go in the last year, I&rsquo;m finding a happy medium, and seeing that it presents a good development experience.
I&rsquo;d lean towards something like Go now, even for automation oriented work when possible.
<em>Seriously, I&rsquo;ve lost so many hours with stupid typo &amp; type issues in languages like PowerShell</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slowly gravitating towards Go for most work, though its verbosity can be annoying compared to a quick PowerShell one-liner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Titles mostly don&rsquo;t matter. Principal Distinguished Staff Lead Engineer from Whatever Company, whatever. What did you do and what did you accomplish. That&rsquo;s all people care about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fellow engineers couldn&rsquo;t care less about your title.
Titles matter to HR when dealing with compensation and determining rates, so don&rsquo;t ignore how important they are outside of the actual job role.</p>
<h2 id="last-thoughts" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#last-thoughts" class="header-mark"></a>Last Thoughts</h2><p>Compiling some principles and thoughts on my experiences could be a good way to think through key areas I&rsquo;ve improved over the years, so I&rsquo;ll probably take a swing at creating my own &ldquo;Career Advice to Myself&rdquo; post. TBD</p>

    <a href="#the-challenge-in-keeping-up-to-date-with-main" class="header-mark"></a>The Challenge In Keeping Up To Date With Main</h2><p>I use what&rsquo;s normally called <code>trunk-based</code> development.
This entails regularly moving commits from branches into the main branch, often rebasing while maintaining it in a functional state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll create a feature branch, bug fix, or refactor branch and then merge this to <code>main</code> as soon as functional.</p>
<p>I prefer a rebase approach on my branches, and when many ci/fix type commits, to squash this into a single unit of work as the results of the PR.
This can result in &ldquo;merge hell&rdquo; as you try rebase on a busy repo.</p>

    <a href="#wrap-up" class="header-mark"></a>Wrap-Up</h2><p>When using git, leveraging some tooling like this can accelerate your workflow.
I don&rsquo;t think you need to be an expert in git to use this, as it helps simplify many workflows that are just too tedious to be diligent on when running manually.</p>
<p>You can also do much of this with git aliases, but Git Town has a pretty robust feature-set with a testing framework in place, edge condition handling, and it&rsquo;s fast.
Consider using it you&rsquo;d like to improve your git workflow while simplifying all the effort to do it right.</p>

<li>Update from <code>main</code> already built in.
This is fantastic, and I can see how this provides a UI to do something similar to <a href="https://www.git-town.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git Town</a> which I blogged on earlier here: <a href="./2021-02-23-git-workflow-with-git-town/" rel="">2021-02-23-git-workflow-with-git-town</a></li>
