        <p>This last Easter I had some fun with the kids at their grandparents. Remember the days of spinning until you were nauseous? Was fun to watch the kids enjoying this so I took a few clips, nothing fancy, just a snapshot of enjoying the little moments in life.</p>
<p>Thinking I&rsquo;ll try this approach for a while. Small 2 minute videos that aren&rsquo;t refined a lot are easy for me to produce. I typically only do a couple a year because I tend to work on them extensively, but maybe just like blogging, consistency and simplicity can be the key to keeping the momentum going.</p>

        <p>Proud to announce Ella the newest addition to my family joined us today @ 6:19pm, weighing in at 6lbs and 11 ounces. Yes, that&rsquo;s 6lbs of cuteness. :-) I&rsquo;m incredibly blessed to have this third addition to my family, and look forward to treasuring every moment with her. God sure knows how to give an amazing gift!</p>
<p>It was a rough 24 hours resulting in our first cesarean experience. This was a bit intense, but Sarah pulled through as a trooper, and we are now finished with post-operation recovery, and enjoying time with our new bundle of awesome.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the prayers!
Now for some sleep&hellip; or not ;-)</p>
<p>Shout out to Willowbrook Women&rsquo;s Center for their consideration and stellar care during the delivery. I left my camera in the other room, not knowing operating room rules, and wanted to respect that, and not complicate the moment. A nurse asked me where my camera was so I could capture a few of the precious first moments, and walked to the other side of the hospital section to go fetch it for me to make it happen. That&rsquo;s how considerate they were!</p>
<p>Thanks to their care I have a healthy baby girl, healthy wife, and some beautiful moments despite the complication of the delivery.</p>

        Recovery is a Marathon, Not a Sprint - Hurricane Harvey

        <p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that the road to recovery is not an instant process. Right now we have a ton of volunteers and people working to help those in need. I&rsquo;m reminding myself, as much as any readers here, the process to recovery for people most impacted is not a single week of effort event. In some cases, entire homes were lost and without flood insurance, the financial devastation can be profound.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/flood_impact.jpg" title="Flood Impact" data-thumbnail="/images/flood_impact.jpg">
        
    </a></figure></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to be part of the Vineyard Church association which is sending an equipped response team to the area to send volunteers and various professionals to aid in recovery. This will definitely help increase the impact we have as people have to go back to work and available time is reduced.</p>

<h2 id="continued-help" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#continued-help" class="header-mark"></a>continued help</h2><p>In the meantime, if you are helping with some giving @ nwvineyard.com/give please consider doing a recoccuring donation for a period of months to continue the help. I&rsquo;m hoping that the impact the church community has in Houston is going to be a testimony to commitment as believers we have in serving those in suffering and in need.</p>
<h2 id="not-be-forgetful" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#not-be-forgetful" class="header-mark"></a>not be forgetful</h2><p>As a reminder to all my fellow followers-of-Christ, our actions are under scrutinity (just see the barrage of accusations against Joel Olsteen right now). As I was driving to a site on the first day back in my house, I saw a small church with a guy riding a lawnmower and trimming a lawn that already looked good.</p>
<p>It made me angry and sad at the same time.</p>
<p>Yes, I should not judge. That church may have had a large response team out serving, and I&rsquo;m probably just seeing part of the picture.</p>
<p>However, that same part of the picture is what others would be seeing. Less than 1 mile up the road were houses devasted by the flood, ripping out drywall, furniture, and dealing with the loss of a lot of belongings. I pray that we all remember the hardship that others are going through and while we can enjoy and relish the moments of life we are given, let us strive to <em>not</em> forget those others those can&rsquo;t move on yet. Those who have lost everything, are in shelters, dealing with the emotional fallout of a disaster, and in the process of rebuilding a place they can call home for their family.</p>

        A Waterlogged Texan Reporting In from Northpoint Tomball

    <a href="#waterlogged" class="header-mark"></a>Waterlogged</h2><p>What a crazy weekend. Choose to evacuate the family as water was slowly creeping up closer to the house. I was ready today when I made it back to the house to see the water in the house, but to my astonishment it was only half-way up the driveway. Turning down the road 1 house away, many houses did not fare so well, and water looks to have made it in many homes.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/View&#43;from&#43;My&#43;Driveway.jpg" title="The view from my driveway. I was seriously blessed, as many others were not as high" data-thumbnail="/images/View&#43;from&#43;My&#43;Driveway.jpg">
        
    </a></figure></p>
<p>It has been a stressful time, and still not finished, but what a remarkable time to see people coming together. From a neighbor walking my family in a small boat to the front to ease the way for the kids and pregant wife in 4 ft of dirty water to the evacuation boats running all day to help get people out. I saw first responders from a surfer walking a raft in his wetsuit to Kemah volunteer firefighters walking the roads to check on people and confirm everyone wanting evacuation was taken care of.</p>

<p>Our area was not as devastated as downtown and other areas that have been on the news, but for us it was still a pretty nerveracking experience.</p>
<p>The hospitality and friendship shown by my church was encouraging, and without these friends we&rsquo;d have been in a tough spot. From driving through some deeper water, to providing warm meals and hospitality (and giving up some rooms/space) for us. As it stands, thanks to my friends I&rsquo;ve got my kids tucked in warm and safe and am able to sit back and think about the days&rsquo; events without being in the rain. Being removed for our home for a week helps put the important things back in perspective for sure!</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/Northern&#43;Point&#43;Entrance.jpg" title="/images/Northern&#43;Point&#43;Entrance.jpg" data-thumbnail="/images/Northern&#43;Point&#43;Entrance.jpg">
        
    </a></figure></p>
<p>If we make it through tonight we should be fine with no water damage, but this storm has definitely given us surprises.</p>
<p>Prayers out there for those in worse situations from this storm. It&rsquo;s been a bit numbing to see just the little pieces I&rsquo;ve seen in the last 2 days. The financial impact (no flood insurance for many in this storm, including us, as we are outside any normal flood areas) is going to be tough, along with the stress and rebuilding that will be required.</p>

        <p>The message of this song is one that that has been driving itself home as more and more important to me.
We are not viewed in our frailty as we come before God to worship Him. We are not judged and condemned. He doesn&rsquo;t look and tell us to come back when we are in a better place.
Instead, just as the author of Hebrews writes (Heb 10), we can come with bold confidence, knowing that the way has been made for us in Christ, with us being viewed through the &ldquo;curtain&rdquo; of Christ. This is critical to every person wanting to draw closer to God, as without a realization that we should be able to approach with confidence and no judgement, we will hold back from fully diving into our relationship with Him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-22
We have, then, my friends, complete freedom to go into the Most Holy Place by means of the death of Jesus. <strong>He opened for us a new way, a living way, through the curtain&mdash;that is, through his own body.</strong> We have a great priest in charge of the house of God. So let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, with hearts that have been purified&hellip;
This has shaped my paradigm a lot. It&rsquo;s hard for me to hear about others feeling unworthy in coming before God, like they have to get things together before coming to Him. This is so antithetical to the nature of God and to all of what we see Christ exemplifying in His life. Christ never demonstrated superiority, judgement against those who don&rsquo;t demonstrate perfection. When He did bring out anger and judgement, it was focused on those who, in their misguided concepts of God, put barriers between God and His people.
So, just a friendly reminder that you &ldquo;Lack for Nothing&rdquo;. Cheers!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first full production attempt with Ableton. I used Ableton Live Lite, with EzDrummer 2 to help generate some drums. Due to running out of time (and patience :-) I just wrapped this up instead of worrying about fine tuning every little piece. I&rsquo;ve got some errant vocal parts, guitar parts, and all, but hope you can just look past this. I ran out of time and &hellip;. and patience to keep reworking.
I actually am working on a series to help fellow worship leaders and musicians just getting into recording learn more about utilizing VSTs, DAW&rsquo;s (like Ableton, Studio One 3), and more. It&rsquo;s bit confusing getting started, so hopefully as I share a little of my journey it might save you some work if you are wanting to try your hand at some creativity.</p>
