        Spotify vs Google Play

        <![CDATA[
        
        
        
            
        
        <p>I&rsquo;ve recently switched over to Spotify for the nth time to explore the Spotiverse world and compare as a long time Google Play Music user. This is a big deal for me, as I was a first adopter of Google Play and have used it before All Access, and subscribed immediately to All Access once it was released. As a ravenous music consumer, I&rsquo;ve preferred the subscription model for instant, on demand access.
This is my personal comparison of some of the strengths and weaknesses of each, compiled over actual usage. Hopefully, it will help anyone who is interested in the differences and trying to decide.</p>
<h2 id="spotify" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#spotify" class="header-mark"></a>Spotify</h2><ol>
<li>Playlists: A wealth of socially driven playlists exist with Spotify. You can even create a adhoc playlist on the fly via their api from your own music app. They also have collaborative lists so it&rsquo;s very easy to build a playlist with like minded folks.</li>
<li>Crossfade: It&rsquo;s a pretty smooth experience to have tracks merge seamlessly. Setting 12 secs of crossfade makes it feel like a DJ is mixing up a radio experience for you.</li>
<li>Radio is getting better than my first experience of it, at playing related music.</li>
<li>Explicit filtering. Spotify doesn&rsquo;t offer as a global setting. They suprisingly seem to have ignored user requests for this. Makes it a little less family friendly if you aren&rsquo;t careful.</li>
<li>Ability to follow artists helps with good &ldquo;new releases&rdquo; I&rsquo;d be interested in.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="google-play" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#google-play" class="header-mark"></a>Google Play</h2><ol>
<li>Radio is ok.</li>
<li>Offline: Pinning a radio station gives you a fresh mix of songs, but not too many. Pinning a playlist in spotify for offline = every song downloaded.</li>
<li>Quality designated for mobile vs wifi. Spotify just has Download vs Stream, with no designation between streaming on a wifi network and mobile network.</li>
<li>Explicit filter is implemented.</li>
<li>Terrible new release feed. For a while it never even updated (some bug in sub-genre at the time I believe). No way to mark uninterested, so recommendations are pretty off.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="things-i-cant-believe-arent-fixed" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#things-i-cant-believe-arent-fixed" class="header-mark"></a>Things I Can&rsquo;t Believe Aren&rsquo;t Fixed</h2><ol>
<li>Global Thumbs Down. Why is this not there! Spotify should add a global thumbs down, instead of just in radio stations. I should be able to dislike a song to remove it from any playlist or the recommended discovery songs. Google Play has a little better experience with this, but still far to limited.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="algorithms-taking-away-my-choice" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#algorithms-taking-away-my-choice" class="header-mark"></a>algorithms taking away my choice?</h2><p>This seems speak to the mentality today that algorithms and user behavior drive all the results, not requiring user feedback. The negative to this is for people like myself who want to improve the results I&rsquo;m offered&hellip; well we are left out in the cold. Pandora offers the best radio design out there, imo. They rely on feedback to help ensure the results are provided as the user wants. I&rsquo;d like to see this design choice in more of the music services instead of them trying to assume they&rsquo;ve identified my preferred choices.</p>
<h2 id="honorable-mention-pandora" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#honorable-mention-pandora" class="header-mark"></a>honorable mention Pandora</h2><p>Overall, the winner for me is Spotify. However, if Pandora&rsquo;s new service wasn&rsquo;t so darn limited in selection, inconsistent with on demand availability, and implemented on desktop as well as mobile I&rsquo;d recommend them. As it stands, I can&rsquo;t recommend it at this time.</p>

        <p>The traditional birthday song is terrible.It&rsquo;s never really changed.
It&rsquo;s like singing a dirge.
It&rsquo;s really really hard for people to sing anywhere close to on key.
We all sing it because we have to, but there is this feeling of regret, like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it for you, but just because I love you&rdquo;.
It is followed by &ldquo;Many mourns&rdquo; by the closest available family clown.
Apparently, the roots were back in the 19th century, and wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1988, Warner/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for US$25 million, with the value of &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; estimated at US$5 million&hellip;.In February 2016 Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, paving the way for the song to become public domain.[18] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WIKI</a>
Let&rsquo;s leave this tainted legacy behind. I propose a radical change.
Ditch it for something fun. Make a new family tradition.</p>

<p>This is much more like Rend Collective&rsquo;s reminder to be always practicing the Art of Celebration :-) It&rsquo;s super easy to sing the first time, promotes foot stomping and hand clapping, promotes dancing and jumping, and overall, I feel conveys the feeling a birthday should have.
New lyrics:</p>
<pre><code>**The Art of Celebration Birthday Song**
- created after much deliberation and refinement in 1 min at the house of Sheldon Hull
Hey hey hey, It's your birthday day
Hey hey hey, It's your birthday day
Hey hey hey, It's your birthday day
Sing Loud, Sing Proud, It's Your Birthday

        <p>Had a blast making this song. Unfortunately, creating video of slow motion pizza cutting was going to be a bit awkward to do, as I didn&rsquo;t feel like asking a pizza place to let me stand behind the counter and video pizza assembly. :-)Best listened to with headphones, not a phone speaker :-)</p>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="ui8XTj23j2E?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 This was an experimentation with several new tools for me.
<h1 id="song-creation" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#song-creation" class="header-mark"></a>song creation</h1><p>I first used Presonus Studio One 3 to record some basic track parts like the guitar. I then added some drums using BFD3 (which I&rsquo;ve previously reviewed). Using the tools to adjust and randomize the velocity and humanize the rhythm helped create something that sounds more realistic.
Then I recorded a fun guitar riff, and used Melodyne Essentials, which is included in Studio One, to convert the guitar part into MIDI. This allowed me to then change the guitar part I had recorded into a MIDI song part and I choose to replace with Pizzicato strings, as I really liked the sound of Presence XT string section. I&rsquo;ve never heard a post-rock style song with pizzicato strings, so figured I might bring a little variety to the post-rock mix.</p>
<h2 id="video-editing" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#video-editing" class="header-mark"></a>video editing</h2><p>The video editing was extremely simplistic. I used Edius 8.2, which is a fantastic NLE for broadcast video editing. I plan on writing or creating a video presentation on that soon to help others interested in video editing to see a little more on that process. I graded with Magic Bullet Looks as I liked the grain and dark feel of the image. Using stabilization effect in Edius, and slowing the speed to 35% (originally 1080p 60fps Panasonic GH3) the resulting imagery was great. I recorded this imagery handheld from this camera on a rainy day in my backyard. I thought the close up of the rain puddling would be interesting for something, and finally found a use.
Hope you enjoy my experiment, I&rsquo;ll work later on doing some walkthroughs for anyone interested more in converting audio to MIDI, basic editing with Edius, and some workflow examples with Presonus Studio One.

        <![CDATA[
        
        
        
            
        
        <p>Creating tracks at home can be very intensive in time, so I&rsquo;m always looking for a better way to bring a larger sound to a track with less effort. One of the big gaps for me has been the drum parts. I&rsquo;ve evaluated a few options, and finally dived into <a href="http://bit.ly/2dHCt87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BFD3 </a>for this latest project that is a post-rock style track. This was my first time diving into BFD3 for a full song, so I had a bit to learn.
<em>Disclaimer: BFD3 generously provided me with a copy to evaluate. This doesn&rsquo;t affect my reviews, as I just love dig in and recommend good software!</em></p>
<h2 id="bfd3---drumming-plugin-extraordinaire" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#bfd3---drumming-plugin-extraordinaire" class="header-mark"></a>BFD3 - Drumming Plugin Extraordinaire</h2><p>I was using this in Presonus Studio One. I created a drum track and then started to explore. I started my exploration based on using the Groove Editor, as I wanted to benefit from the library of preset grooves that were already created, and use these with some modifications to be the drum parts for me song, allowing me to hopefully create the track I wanted quickly.  There is a lot of functionality I&rsquo;m not going to dive into, such as the vast array of microphone adjustments, compression options, and other mixing options. My focus is going to be as a songwriter, how could I use this to help me generate a believable drum track for my song without it being an ordeal.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-existing-kit" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#modifying-existing-kit" class="header-mark"></a>Modifying Existing Kit</h2><p>One thing that was really easy to do with BFD3 was modify the kit configuration. I liked the sound of Pork Pie Kick for this song, so I just played a groove, and then switched it over with the checkbox (on hover).</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/modifying-existing-kit.png" title="Modifying Existing Kit" data-thumbnail="/images/modifying-existing-kit.png">
        
    </a></figure></p>
<p>#Grooves
The Grooves section provides a preset set of associated rhythms to allow you to easily prepare a song based on related rhythms. This is ideal for helping you create a song quickly by finding associated rhythms.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/bfd3-home.png" title="BFD3 Groove Page" data-thumbnail="/images/bfd3-home.png">
        
    </a></figure></p>

    </a></figure></p>
<p>###Copy and Replicate a Groove to Tweak</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/02_CopyAndEditGrooves.gif" title="/images/02_CopyAndEditGrooves.gif" data-thumbnail="/images/02_CopyAndEditGrooves.gif">
        
    </a></figure></p>
<h3 id="change-velocity-for-realism" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#change-velocity-for-realism" class="header-mark"></a>Change Velocity for Realism</h3><p>This is really important to a natural sounding drum part. You definitely do not want everything at the same velocity as no real drummer would do this. There are some easy ways to adjust the velocity as well as the humanization of the rhythm in both Presonus Studio One 3 and BFD3 plugin. In this example, I adjust it in BFD3 directly.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/02_ChangingVelocityForRealism.gif" title="/images/02_ChangingVelocityForRealism.gif" data-thumbnail="/images/02_ChangingVelocityForRealism.gif">

    </a></figure></p>
<h3 id="practice-your-rudiments" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#practice-your-rudiments" class="header-mark"></a>Practice Your Rudiments</h3><p>One other cool feature for quickly pumping out some grooves is the ability to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; the rudiment you&rsquo;ve selected. This means you could easily pick some drag paradiddles on the snare without having to click each point in time. I found this incredible helpful for creating some interesting grooves.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/05_PaintRudiments.gif" title="/images/05_PaintRudiments.gif" data-thumbnail="/images/05_PaintRudiments.gif">
        
    </a></figure></p>
<h1 id="quick-note-on-versions" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#quick-note-on-versions" class="header-mark"></a>Quick Note on Versions</h1><p>I tried the BFD3 Eco, but due to wanting flexibility to edit the grooves and do more tweaks, the Eco version was not a good fit for for me. If, however, you are looking for an experience that is more groove oriented, with less tweaking/adjustments, then you should consider starting with the Lite version. If you are looking for the full flexibility then you might want to evaluate the full one instead.
FXpansion indicates on their support page in the comparison on the differences that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the differences between BFD Eco and BFD2/BFD3?
BFD Eco is optimized for ease of use and fast results - it is deep enough for deeply sculpting drum sounds into all manner of shapes but is streamlined enough so that you won&rsquo;t be overwhelmed with options.
It has less detailed sounds than BFD2 and BFD3 but is much more light on system resources.
BFD2 and BFD3 contain far more control over each aspect of each kit-piece as well as a configurable mixing engine with custom aux channels and much more. They also feature full editing of Grooves, more control over exports and many other features too numerous to list. <a href="http://bit.ly/2dHC4Cl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FXpansion Support Article</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="final-thoughts" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#final-thoughts" class="header-mark"></a>Final Thoughts</h1><p>The power and flexibility of this software is pretty amazing. I&rsquo;ve only touched on a small fraction of what it is supposed to be capable of, as I&rsquo;m using a lot of the simple functionality to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; some rhythms.
I was a little disappointed in the initial groove library as far as the single 6/8 groove test goes, as it felt more difficult to get a groove I liked than when I demoed Ez Drummer</p>
<p>However, the flexibility in editing with the easy humanization and editing of the kit made up for this. I think the vast sound library of plugin packs is what is designed to expand this, so I&rsquo;ll probably cover some of those later to evaluate if they fill in the gap on providing a even larger variety of preset grooves for the wannabe composer. Note that the library is around 40GB for the initial load, so my isolated 6/8 groove test isn&rsquo;t reflective of the rest of the available library. There is a lot to work with, and the expansion libraries seem to be pretty vast in number.</p>
<p>Another area that would be awesome to enhance is providing something similar to &ldquo;song finder&rdquo; that EzDrummer 2 had, where a certain rhythm was tapped, and related matches found. EzDrummer 2 then provides something similar to Grooves where the song structures for verse, chorus, bridge, etc are laid out. I&rsquo;m not partial to the format that EzDrummer used, I actually prefer the Groove library format of BFD3, but I sure would love seeing the search capability added to help quickly match grooves fitting the feel you are trying for.
I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the documentation and support, as they have a wide range of well made videos showing demonstrations on the product, how to use, etc. I look forward to incorporating this into my workflow and going through some more training videos to better understand a solid workflow, as I&rsquo;m just starting to wrap my head around it, along with learning how to navigate Presonus Studio One</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2dHCt87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out a trial</a> if you want to give it a shot and post some feedback below on what you think. Remember, I&rsquo;m not an affiliate, or getting paid for anything on this, I just like reviewing and referring folks to good software.
Good luck!</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m a geek, software nerd, and a musician. As I&rsquo;ve been stagnating lately in my musical progression I decided to dive into trying to produce some recordings of some of my music, hoping to spice up the old brain.I have a lot to learn. It&rsquo;s pretty humbling, but despite being a musician and a developer with some decent tinkering ability, I&rsquo;ve found getting into recording and production a bit challenging on certain things. If you come from a background in which you understand terms such as pre/post, bus, gain structure, compression ration, and other terms then your learning curve will be much easier. For me, my extent of dealing with these terms was focused on guitar pedal settings and an analogue mixing board.
This has made things much tougher, as I&rsquo;ve been learning terminology along with methodology.
I&rsquo;ve also been pretty astonished with some of the technology solutions I had never explored that allow a much richer musical creation for a musician.
I figured I&rsquo;d share my progress as I work through some of these things in case it helps some others on the road. This is not attempting to be a profound treatise, full step by step walkthrough, but more focusing on sharing some of the problems as well as things I&rsquo;ve discovered. Maybe you&rsquo;ll save some time, or get some new ideas if this is a new venture for you as well!</p>
<h1 id="presonus-studio-one-3-professional" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#presonus-studio-one-3-professional" class="header-mark"></a>Presonus Studio One 3 Professional</h1><p>This is probably going to be my primary DAW. My initial impressions are extremely positive. The only competitor in my current focus is Ableton since I enjoy live looping, and the session/arrangement integration. However, for pure DAW focus, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d be as comfortable long-term with Ableton since I&rsquo;m not primarily an electronic loop/sample based writer.
The details I&rsquo;ll be posting are on the Professional Edition, so some of the functionality might not be available in the other versions. <a href="http://www.presonus.com/products/studio-one/compare-versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See their version comparison for exact details. </a>
Disclaimer: <em>Presonus generously provided a license for my evaluation. However, please note that I am not biased in my review, as I believe in providing unfiltered feedback.</em></p>
<h1 id="getting-content-installed" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#getting-content-installed" class="header-mark"></a>Getting Content Installed</h1><p>I ran into some serious download issues when using the Presonus content installer. In reading forum posts, I see that this has occasionally cropped up. If this happens to you, run just go to the presonus account page and download directly with your internet browser, as it ran much faster for me. This was the only major hitch in my install. Maybe a better CDN is in order?</p>
<h1 id="first-impressions" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#first-impressions" class="header-mark"></a>first impressions</h1><p>So far, very intuitive interface. I&rsquo;m not a DAW expert by any means, so I&rsquo;ve been looking for something that had a natural feel to someone familiar with the basics of recording, yet more powerful functionality that will help me create and arrangement more complex pieces. So far, it feels like Presonus Studio One 3 is living up to the reputation I&rsquo;ve found online for being getting out of the way and enabling creative workflow. I haven&rsquo;t even dived into the scratchpad functionality, but even my first project has been a very pleasant experience, with none of the &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; moments I had in getting this to work with Ableton Live (though I still prefer this for live looping right now).</p>
<h1 id="novation-launchkey-49-setup" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#novation-launchkey-49-setup" class="header-mark"></a>Novation Launchkey 49 Setup</h1><p>Setting up a midi device has been a learning experience. Working with Studio One required a bit of experimentation, as it wasn&rsquo;t preset, but I finally got it to work. It would be nice if they offered more presets, but at least I got it working! Not all the controls seemed to be mapped, but Launchkey has &ldquo;InControl&rdquo; functionality, so I plan on evaluating this soon.
To find the midi port a device is working on with Windows, go to device manager, and you can see the midi port displayed so you know what to configure.</p>

<h1 id="clean-interface" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#clean-interface" class="header-mark"></a>Clean interface</h1><p>The interface is clean, designed to be a single screen view without a lot of navigation required. The context menu options are kept organized and clean. For me, Reaper was a great DAW, had a lot of functionality for the price, but was very context menu driven and this was a lot to get used to. I think Presonus has done an admirable job of organizing the many options to keep things from getting too messy.</p>

One thing I liked was the focus on &ldquo;songs&rdquo;, as it offered the creation of a new &ldquo;song&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Files/projects&rdquo;. This felt like such a great design decision as it focused on the creation aspect of new songs.</p>

<h1 id="presence-xt-and-virtual-instruments" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#presence-xt-and-virtual-instruments" class="header-mark"></a>Presence XT and Virtual Instruments</h1><p>A package of instruments are included in Studio One. I enjoyed the Cello and Pizzicato string sections in particular. I&rsquo;ll probably post more on this later as I discuss Melodyne integration.</p>

<h1 id="vst-configuration" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#vst-configuration" class="header-mark"></a>VST configuration</h1><p>Nice and easy to find. No problems here. Was happy to see it supports 32, 64, VST3 and more. Ableton Lite didn&rsquo;t support 32bit, so I had a lot of VST&rsquo;s downloaded that I couldn&rsquo;t use.</p>

<h1 id="other-stuff-for-the-future" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#other-stuff-for-the-future" class="header-mark"></a>other stuff for the future</h1><p>I plan on discussing the Arrangement functionality as it helps to bridge the gap of organizing complex tracks, as well as scratchpad, which was the primary function I was excited to try, as it seems a win for someone experimenting with various versions.
I&rsquo;ve plan on showing how to convert guitar riffs into a cello, quantizing notes for more precision on a fast run, folding/unfolding multiple takes, and more. It&rsquo;s crazy how much is packed in here, but I&rsquo;m completely loving it.</p>
<h1 id="any-cons" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#any-cons" class="header-mark"></a>any cons?</h1><p>So far, the biggest thing I&rsquo;m missing is a drum generator such as EzDrummer
2. I had planned on doing a review of this, but my trial ran out and I haven&rsquo;t heard from them if they do any licenses for press reviews. Addictive drummer seems ok, but the trial is so limited, I&rsquo;m really not able to leverage, and the single few tracks I was able to try didn&rsquo;t hit what I needed (demo removes all cymbals). EzDrummer 2 was pretty darn good in helping me create some believable tracks. Superior Drummer also seems promising but I couldn&rsquo;t find any trial for it.
If Presonus had something equivalent to EzDrummer 2 to generate believable drum tracks and rhythms based on building the drums that would be awesome. As it is, it seems to focus on some drum samples and loops, but not a full built engine like EzDrummer 2 offers. If I end up hearing back from Toontracks on their products and obtain copies, I&rsquo;ll be sure to post up more details at that point for the aspiring non drumming arrangers among us.</p>

        <p>Had a chance to look at this program thanks to the generosity of the developer. They had a promotion that ended prematurely and they sent me a license as a goodwill gesture. Pretty fantastic service, and thanks to them for this.The documentation was a little sparse for the Windows setup, so I ran into some complications getting it to work.</p>
<p>I have used TouchOSC, and had some difficulty with configuring it for windows. True to other&rsquo;s postings, Lemur didn&rsquo;t make this easier. Especially as a windows user, this is not a simple plug and play and go type of tool. If you are looking for that then you&rsquo;d be better served by looking a Touchable, Conductr, or something similar that provides the full package.
The difference is that Lemur offers a complete &ldquo;development&rdquo; environment for templates and automation. The sky is the limit. You can even have a single ipad controlling multiple computers based on the midi being mapped on one controller to various destinations.
To get Lemur talking to Ableton Live (9.6), this is pretty much what worked for me after experimenting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Lemur</li>
<li>Install Live Control 2 (basically just a set of template and automation scripts)</li>
<li>Copy Live Control Template onto ipad (you can drag the file directly to the app in Itunes and hit sync)</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://bit.ly/2cyHGLt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoopBe</a>. Note I tried rptMidi as well as LoopMidi, and this is the only one that worked without issue for me on Windows 10.</li>
<li>Setup Lemur Daemon service as shown in screenshot.

    </a></figure></li>
<li>In ableton I setup as the following:
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/2016-09-17_13-54-06.png" title="2016-09-17_13-54-06" data-thumbnail="/images/2016-09-17_13-54-06.png">
        
    </a></figure></li>
<li>If you drag a drum track into a channel and activate for recording, you can tap in the &ldquo;play&rdquo; tab and change &ldquo;key&rdquo; to &ldquo;drum&rdquo;. Then you can find the appropriate drum machine field by scrolling up or down.
This got the initial setup going so I was able to drop a drum track in, and tap out a rhythm. I think I&rsquo;m going to have invest more time into it to get what I want, so the jury is out for me as a casual user whether or not I&rsquo;ll be able to leverage this vs TouchOSC or touchable. It&rsquo;s pretty powerful, just pretty complex!
As a person primarily focused with Live for DAW and home recording/experimentation, I&rsquo;m probably not going to leverage fully at this time like others would. If I gain some more traction with it, I&rsquo;ll try and post some more useful updates. Both TouchOSC and Lemur are designed for customization. If you want to get going with limited setup, look at Touchable, Conductr, or another similar to that.</li>

        <p>The message of this song is one that that has been driving itself home as more and more important to me.
We are not viewed in our frailty as we come before God to worship Him. We are not judged and condemned. He doesn&rsquo;t look and tell us to come back when we are in a better place.
Instead, just as the author of Hebrews writes (Heb 10), we can come with bold confidence, knowing that the way has been made for us in Christ, with us being viewed through the &ldquo;curtain&rdquo; of Christ. This is critical to every person wanting to draw closer to God, as without a realization that we should be able to approach with confidence and no judgement, we will hold back from fully diving into our relationship with Him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-22
We have, then, my friends, complete freedom to go into the Most Holy Place by means of the death of Jesus. <strong>He opened for us a new way, a living way, through the curtain&mdash;that is, through his own body.</strong> We have a great priest in charge of the house of God. So let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, with hearts that have been purified&hellip;
This has shaped my paradigm a lot. It&rsquo;s hard for me to hear about others feeling unworthy in coming before God, like they have to get things together before coming to Him. This is so antithetical to the nature of God and to all of what we see Christ exemplifying in His life. Christ never demonstrated superiority, judgement against those who don&rsquo;t demonstrate perfection. When He did bring out anger and judgement, it was focused on those who, in their misguided concepts of God, put barriers between God and His people.
So, just a friendly reminder that you &ldquo;Lack for Nothing&rdquo;. Cheers!</p>

<p><strong><em>disclaimer</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my first full production attempt with Ableton. I used Ableton Live Lite, with EzDrummer 2 to help generate some drums. Due to running out of time (and patience :-) I just wrapped this up instead of worrying about fine tuning every little piece. I&rsquo;ve got some errant vocal parts, guitar parts, and all, but hope you can just look past this. I ran out of time and &hellip;. and patience to keep reworking.
I actually am working on a series to help fellow worship leaders and musicians just getting into recording learn more about utilizing VSTs, DAW&rsquo;s (like Ableton, Studio One 3), and more. It&rsquo;s bit confusing getting started, so hopefully as I share a little of my journey it might save you some work if you are wanting to try your hand at some creativity.</p>

        <p>Just recently discovered this artist after being exposed to an article from Worship Leader magazine. Fantastic dynamics. The dynamics and beautiful harmonies are pretty darn close to what I&rsquo;d love experimenting with if I had a group of folks playing those instruments. Interestingly, the vocal harmonies are very simple, but I found very beautiful. It&rsquo;s compromised of a tenor and a baritone range, and is a fresh change stuff like Shane and Shane which both have incredibly high ranges. I found it very approachable to enjoy singing with. The power of the musical dynamics and beautiful lyrics was a major win. I&rsquo;ll be following them closely.</p>
