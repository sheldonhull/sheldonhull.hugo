        <![CDATA[
        
        
        
            
        
        <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve left New York, here&rsquo;s what I had started capturing.</p>
<p><strong>Ella</strong>: She&rsquo;s too tired right now to narrate, but there&rsquo;s a few funny highlights from her day.
One of the challenges I gave the kids was to find the first official New York City rat.
Ella scored the first point and was very proud of that.
She also spent much of the day chasing pigeons and generally being a rascal.
Of all the things she noticed, it was stuff like a pair of tennis shoes hanging from a cable line.
Gotta love the perspective of kids.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Karis</strong>: I think I waited too long to get anything from her.
She politely declined any update, and she&rsquo;s essentially passed out asleep on the bed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Karsten</strong>: We did stuff. Fine I&rsquo;ll say more stuff. We walked and walked and walked some more, we went to a museum and talked to one of dad&rsquo;s friends and that&rsquo;s about it. We walked and walked‚Ä¶ And walked&hellip; Seriously, Dad can I be done now?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, my reticent children didn&rsquo;t give me a lot right now.
I can&rsquo;t really blame them considering it was a pretty long day.
Setting the challenge of finding a NY rat and seeing it acccomplished within the first day was a funny win.
Happened to be pretty crowded due to Halloween.
Got to meet one of my friends from work, Jamieson and his wife Michelle (sorry if I got the spelling wrong).
During my quick tour of New York, I had the best pizza (gluten free!) at Don Antonios. I paid for this with selling one my children to them, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>The New York subway was suprising in it&rsquo;s efficiency and speed.
In contrast to the French trains I&rsquo;ve been taking (and will post on later), it rockets off, has bare metal everywhere, and feels like it just fits the New York sense of efficiency.
Waiting on restrooms in lines was also a good taste of what was to come in Europe.</p>
<p>New York is a remarkable city to visit, but I don&rsquo;t see myself ever wanting to leave there.
The value I have to a slightly slower pace, more space, and legroom just don&rsquo;t gel well with that city.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong>: She had her hands and mind full so no details to add right now here.
We wouldn&rsquo;t have this trip without her incredible effort, so gotta give her a break here üòÅ.</p>

        <p>Proud to announce Ella the newest addition to my family joined us today @ 6:19pm, weighing in at 6lbs and 11 ounces. Yes, that&rsquo;s 6lbs of cuteness. :-) I&rsquo;m incredibly blessed to have this third addition to my family, and look forward to treasuring every moment with her. God sure knows how to give an amazing gift!</p>
<p>It was a rough 24 hours resulting in our first cesarean experience. This was a bit intense, but Sarah pulled through as a trooper, and we are now finished with post-operation recovery, and enjoying time with our new bundle of awesome.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the prayers!
Now for some sleep&hellip; or not ;-)</p>
<p>Shout out to Willowbrook Women&rsquo;s Center for their consideration and stellar care during the delivery. I left my camera in the other room, not knowing operating room rules, and wanted to respect that, and not complicate the moment. A nurse asked me where my camera was so I could capture a few of the precious first moments, and walked to the other side of the hospital section to go fetch it for me to make it happen. That&rsquo;s how considerate they were!</p>
<p>Thanks to their care I have a healthy baby girl, healthy wife, and some beautiful moments despite the complication of the delivery.</p>

        Red Gate Dependency Tracker - Making Databases Into Moving Art

        <h2 id="data-structures-are-art" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#data-structures-are-art" class="header-mark"></a>data structures are art</h2><p>If anyone thinks that working with complex data structures is boring&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what world they live in. The problem is often that sql tables and data structures are just script files and lists of tables in an object explorer.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1jOUyjgO0_A?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0&autoplay=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autohide=1&loop=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 However, once you crack open the visual aspect of database diagramming and data architecture, you can see some interesting patterns emerge.
<h2 id="red-gate-dependency-viewer-tracker" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#red-gate-dependency-viewer-tracker" class="header-mark"></a>red gate dependency viewer tracker</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve long enjoyed playing around with <a href="http://bit.ly/24l4Xnk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Gate Dependency Tracker</a>. I&rsquo;ve found it a great tool for interacting with dependencies and visually working through their relationships.
I figured I&rsquo;d share with others a more artistic side of database architecture, as I&rsquo;ve never seen it done, and I found it uniquely beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="visual-review-of-data-structures" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#visual-review-of-data-structures" class="header-mark"></a>visual review of data structures</h2><p>This is the architecture of the application I work on everyday. I inherited care of a system that shows the attention and design that was put into it. The order of the key relationships is obvious. I&rsquo;ve worked on some systems that this diagram would be completely different story without the order and structure.
The interesting part about the visual dependency view is you can often see orphaned objects that aren&rsquo;t correctly linked to their parent objects, so it can serve as a useful tool to help improve existing designs. My previous article about tools I&rsquo;ve use for this is here&hellip;<a href="/documenting-your-database-with-diagrams/" rel="">Documenting Your Database with Diagrams</a>
Enjoy!</p>
