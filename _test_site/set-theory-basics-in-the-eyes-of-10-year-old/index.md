# Set Theory Basics in the Eyes of 10 Year Old


My morning. Explaining set and intersect theory basics to my 10 year old with Minecraft gamer tags.
Trying to justify the need to know this, the best I could come up with was his future need to build a shark attack report accurately.

Kids are the best. Tech is fun. What job would have me spin up with `docker-compose up -d` my MSSQL container, write a quick SQL example with `INTERSECT`, `UNION` and all to demonstrate this magic.

Followed it up with a half-hearted lie that my day is comprised of `cmatrix` ðŸ˜‚  which he didn&#39;t believe for more than a couple seconds.
