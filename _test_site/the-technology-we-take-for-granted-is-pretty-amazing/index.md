# The Technology We Take for Granted Is Pretty Amazing


We had some intense rapid storms hit last night that caused power failure for roughly 30-40% of Greater Houston area.

Time to test some of my flexible DR developer setup üí™.

I&#39;m sitting the middle row of a nice minivan posting this (thanks Dad for the killer deal! üòÅ)... and it got me thinking of the &#34;simple&#34; tech we take for granted.

- I&#39;m charging with a 100w AC port in the minivan.[^1]
- I&#39;m connected to the internet by merely connecting my iphone via usb to the mac, no extra configuration or steps required.
- I&#39;m then able to push code, deploy to ~~production~~ ahem, development environments.
- Get code completions from a LLM directly inline my editor while driving and even generate new code projects via copilot with workspace.

There&#39;s so much incredible engineering behind the simple act of connecting a phone to my computer and then having access to all this, it&#39;s incredible.

[^1]: As someone who grew up on Windows, it was very confusing that this internet sharing happens automatically when iPhone is plugged in. I searched throughout all settings to find it &#34;just works&#34;.
