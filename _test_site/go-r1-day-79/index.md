# Go R1 Day 79


## progress

Felt like revisiting Exercism since the great updates and wanting a break from the more deep concept dives on mechnical sympathy and optimization in the Ultimate Go course (which is stellar).

Completed the following to continue on syllabus.
It&#39;s taking me back to basics, but stuff I can knock out pretty quick.

- [Weather Forcast](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/weather-forecast/solutions/sheldonhull) code commenting concepts.
- [Cars Assemble](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/cars-assemble/solutions/sheldonhull) covering basic if statements... yawn.
Used switch statement for kicks
- [Annalyn&#39;s Infiltration](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/annalyns-infiltration/solutions/sheldonhull) boolean concepts.

From this I determined that I&#39;m great at writing chained boolean statements.

    if goodAtBool &amp;&amp; coderIsMe {
        fmt.Println(&#34;I&#39;m a good coder&#34;)
    } else if goodAtBool &amp;&amp; !coderIsMe {
        fmt.Println(&#34;I&#39;m a good coder&#34;)
    } else if !goodAtBool &amp;&amp; coderIsMe {
        fmt.Println(&#34;I&#39;m a bad coder&#34;)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(&#34;I&#39;m a bad coder&#34;)
    }

Thank you GitHub Copilot for the codeblock above.
