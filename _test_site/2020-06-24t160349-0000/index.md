After using Windows versions of launchers that tried to emulate [Alfred](https://bit.ly/2A3J08c &#34;Alfred&#34;), I finally took the plunge and bought Alfred&#39;s Powerpack. The buyer remorse of paying &gt; $60 on a &#34;shortcut&#34; app hasn&#39;t really set in as I&#39;m seeing such a wealth of great features that I think the gains as a developer and shortcut aficionado will be well worth the cost in my workflow. So far, highly recommend. The best part for me is the easy plugging in of bash/pwsh scripts to execute on demand for quick productivity tasks without having to navigate and open it up in the terminal.
