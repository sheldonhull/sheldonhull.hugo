# Time With Family - Thanksgiving


I&#39;ve made it my personal quest as a creative who has a passion for videography to try and capture simple moments during my life with family. There are plenty of epic indie films, and I can&#39;t commit this type of time with a day job, family, and other interests. I think this is a good start. Thanks to Robert &amp; Steph for their hospitality and making this a special thanksgiving. Was a wonderful time with family
