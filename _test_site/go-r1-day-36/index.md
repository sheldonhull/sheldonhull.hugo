# Go R1 Day 36


## progress

- more taskflow work
- learned how to use io.Multiwriter to have both a stdout stream as well as output captured to a `stringbuilder`.
- got confused on reading docs, only to realize I was reading docs for a C# solution. ðŸ˜‚
- used Pterm[^pterm] to beautiful console output, which was pretty cool to see in action.

[^pterm]: [pterm/pterm: âœ¨ #PTerm is a modern go module to beautify console output](https://bit.ly/3da2Z5U)
