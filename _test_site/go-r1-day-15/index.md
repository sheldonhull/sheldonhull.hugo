# Go R1 Day 15


## Day 15 of 100

## progress

- figured out scope issues with pointer and struct
- Used `omitempty` in struct
- exported final report in json format after searching for matching image id from ec2 instance image id
- Find it interesting how much more wordy the go search method was, but appreciate it in a way as the &#34;syntactic&#34; sugar that&#39;s missing also is the reason there is more complication at times in languages like PowerShell/C#.
