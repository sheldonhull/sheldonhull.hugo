# Github Pages Now Supports Private Pages


I&#39;m a huge static site fan (lookup jamstack).

What I&#39;ve historically had a problem with was hosting.
For public pages, it&#39;s great.

For private internal docs, it&#39;s been problematic.
It&#39;s more servers and access control to manage if you want something for a specific group inside a company to access.

This new update is a big deal for those that want to provide an internal hugo, jekyll, mkdocs, or other static generate based documentation site for their team.
