# SSMS 2012 Extender for the times you want some organization to the random pile


When dealing with large amounts of objects in a database, navigation can be tedious with SSMS object explorer. This extender organizes the objects into groups based on schema, helping a developer easily navigate to the appropriate object. The current version didn&#39;t work for views, but the other objects were grouped effectively. Highly recommend!
