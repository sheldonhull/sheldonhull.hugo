# SQL Compare 12: Initial Look


I know there have been a few other folks going into more detail on SQL Compare 12 (beta), but I thought I&#39;d share just a few looks at the new design. Looks pretty slick, and I like where the design is going. Just a quick look, as I&#39;m sure there will be more to cover when it&#39;s finally released. Until then....

## Some GUI Improvements

Very clean. Not too drastic of a change to mess with current workflows. Still, nice to see some clean design like this.

## Options dialogue

Same options, just slightly different navigation/ui design to get there.

## Comparing databases

Comparing running... saving me a massive amount of work in not creating scripts by hand :-)

## Final thoughts

Again, this was just a quick peek at what I&#39;ve looked at. Overall, I like the design choices.
UI Design improvements are nice. I would say the next stage would be seeing this better design roll-out into better report styling &amp; formats, making it consistent. Additionally, while the UI improvements are nice, the code diff viewer at the bottom looks pretty similar, and I&#39;d love the ability to have this improved a little. Perhaps even the option to use &#34;external diff viewer&#34; and pipe it into my preferred diff viewer (Araxis Merge for me).
Officially, I&#39;m part of the Friend&#39;s of Red Gate community now, so I&#39;ll probably be posting a bit more on their tools as I&#39;ve got the chance to work with more of them now. I&#39;ve always been a big fan of their products, and now I get a chance to be part of their community and help with testing, feedback, and advocating their great stuff when it would help folks out.
Final thought... why can&#39;t all great tools have a full Solarized Dark theme? ;-)
