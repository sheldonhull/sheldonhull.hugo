# Go R1 Day 1


## Day 1 of 100

## progress

- Cloned `learning-go-with-tests` to ensure a nice structured start, even though I&#39;ve already done `hello-world`
- Setup fresh `gotools` updates - Ran golangci-lint through docker to ensure improved linting options ready for further tests
- Fixed default debug template in vscode to use workspacefolder instead of file directory. Strange that it defaulted to the wrong path.
