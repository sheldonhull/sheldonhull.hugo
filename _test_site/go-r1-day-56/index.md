# Go R1 Day 56


## progress

- Worked on ci-cd pipelines for Go apps.
- Learned a bit more on building Azure Pipeline templates to use with Go, learning a bit from SignalFx and how they did it.
- Read more on semver versioning, and still can&#39;t find anything as good as [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion)
