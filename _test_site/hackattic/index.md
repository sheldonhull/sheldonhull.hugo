# Hackattic


Came across this pretty nifty site [HackAttic](https://bit.ly/33AL4j8) that provides a small set of practical oriented exercises.
Will look at using further in my Go journey, as seems really useful to stretch one&#39;s development skills in less familar, but still practical ways.

A few of the challenges:

- Generate an SSL certificate according to given data.
- Extract some data from Redis. In a way.
- Handle some incoming JWTs for us.

Take a look at the [newsletter](https://bit.ly/3uGYuWz) topics covered.
I love that sense of humor.
