## Core Values

I live as a follower of Christ, desiring to impact the world around with who He is.
I&#39;m an unashamed disciple and though I&#39;ve got plenty I mess up, following Him is my joy.

## Family

I&#39;ve been blessed with 3 kids and a wonderful wife Sarah who has brought beauty into my world and to my life.
I&#39;m thankful for the richness of family and experiencing this journey.

## Work

I â™¥ code. Right now Go is my primary focus.

I also think the world needs more emojis and tacos ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ® to lighten things up.

If you are bored and want to see my brag sheet, here you go: [brag sheet]({{&lt; relref &#34;brag.md&#34; &gt;}})

It&#39;s a :construction: wip that I plan on adding some accomplishments to over time.

## Other Interests

My passions extend beyond technology into the creative realm as well.
I&#39;ve enjoyed doing videography, photography, and creating music.
Electric &amp; acoustic guitar have always been a passion.
I&#39;m a sucker for good post-rock music, which I think is the best type of music for coding around.

## Music - On Desk
