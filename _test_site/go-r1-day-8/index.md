# Go R1 Day 8


## Day 8 of 100

## progress

- Worked through Algorithms in Go: `Determine if a number is in a list`
- Passed the tests without needing to find the solution, so that&#39;s a win.
- Had to remember to grab the second value from the range operator like `for _, i := range items` instead of using `foreach($i in $items)` like PowerShell would do. It&#39;s more similar to using hashtables with `GetEnumerator()`.
- Used codespaces with Docker and also experimented with WSL2 and Visual Studio Code mounting the directory from inside WSL2.
