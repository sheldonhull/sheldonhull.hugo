You know you are a dad when you start looking at a minivan as a really cool vehicle and marvel at all the features that have zilch to do with driving. $35-40k for a glorified station wagon with sliding doors would probably make sane humans question reality, while #dadlife looks at sliding doors as less risk for door ding claims from his little rascals.

You know you have a researching mentality when you begin to investigate minivan prejudices impact in the market against widerspread adoption. #bunnytrail
