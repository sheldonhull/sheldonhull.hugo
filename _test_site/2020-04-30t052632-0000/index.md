Got some use out of the new beta plugins for netlify.

I added a link checker task and it ran over 2000 internal tests to ensure all internal resources such as images, internal links, and even css assests all correctly were found. ğŸ§¹

That&#39;s a great idea for static sites. Incremental maintenance always is better than trying to catch up after years of no upkeep.
