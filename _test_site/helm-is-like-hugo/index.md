# Helm Is Like Hugo


Turns out helm is pretty intuitive if you already have been working with something like Hugo, which is Go template driven.

Was able to convert an entire K8 stack to helm with a couple hours of work and render everything.

I have this problem of trying to avoid percieved complex tools in an attempt to reduce &#34;another tool&#34; syndrome for others I work with.
Sometimes, it&#39;s important to keep in mind who is editing and doing the majority of the work, and not worry as much about the long-term solution over delivery.

That&#39;s always a tough balance since I tend to think outside the scope of a single team due to the style of work I&#39;ve done.
I think I&#39;m slowly getting there. ðŸ˜€
