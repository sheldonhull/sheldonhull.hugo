# Go R1 Day 33


## progress

- successfully created logging package using zerolog
- learned about scoping with packages
- linked to a private internal repository and how to leverage the module replace operator to temporarily alter path import from url to local override.
- middleware is a newer concept, so I need to learn more on this later so I can understand how to use to inject special log handling for http requests and other actions.

Thoughts for today are that the pressure of jumping into an existing codebase is resulting in me moving faster than I probably should.
I&#39;m going to take some time to keep doing the web fundamentals, lambda, and exercisms to ensure I&#39;m setting a better foundation long-term, and not just winging it. ðŸ˜„
