# Go R1 Day 69


## progress

- Read on functional options in Go. I&#39;ve seen this used with Pterm, Zerolog, and other tools, but didn&#39;t know this pattern had a name.
- WalkDir is a newer function available in Go 1.16.
It&#39;s recommended for future work, but found very few examples.
Adjusted my line break code to use `WalkDir`.
