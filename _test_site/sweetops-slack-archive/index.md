# SweetOps Slack Archive


Just wanted to give props to the Cloudposse team lead by Erik Osterman [@eosterman](https://twitter.com/eosterman).

Slack provides a great community chat experience, but there are quite a few problems about using it for Q&amp;A. [^tools-and-communities]
Since the free plans for communities hide content over 10,000 messages, a healthy community will go over this quickly.

With all the great conversations, I want to find prior discussions to benefit from topics already covered.

Cloudposse archives the community discussions so they can be searched.

Cloudposse archives the community discussions for future searches here: [SweetOps Archive](https://archive.sweetops.com).

## Pro-Tip Search Aliases

If you use Alfred you can setup an alias for this, or use a Chrome Search Engine Alias.
To use a Chrome search engine alias, go to: [Search Engines](chrome://settings/searchEngines) and add a new entry.

- Search Engine: `cloudposse`
- Keyword: `cloudposse`
- URL with %s in place of query: `https://archive.sweetops.com/search?query=%s`

For any future search, just type in cloudposse in the searchbar and whatever you type after that will open up in the archive search.

[^tools-and-communities]: I don&#39;t think Cloudposse or many others deny that Slack is &#34;inferior&#34; for threaded conversation to a tool like Discourse.
However, despite it being a &#34;walled garden&#34;, it&#39;s a lot easier to get engagement there than a forum from what I understand.
This solution provides a nice middle ground by giving the ease of Slack, while ensuring great conversation is still captured and able to be found.
