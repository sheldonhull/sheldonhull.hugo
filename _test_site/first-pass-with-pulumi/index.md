# First Pass With Pulumi


## Why

Instead of learning a new domain specific language that wraps up cloud provider API&#39;s, this let&#39;s the developer use their preferred programming language, while solving several problems that using the API&#39;s directly don&#39;t solve.

- Ensure the deployment captures a state file of the changes made.
- Workflow around the previews and deployments.
- Easily automated policy checks and tests.

This can be a really useful tool to bring infrastructure code maintainability directly into the the lifecycle of the application.

It&#39;s subjective to those in DevOps whether this would also apply for &#34;Day 0-2&#34; type operations, which are typically less frequently changed resources such as account settings, VPC, and other more static resources.

However, with a team experienced with Go or other tooling, I could see that this would provide a way to have much more programmatic control, loops, and other external libraries used, without resorting to the HCL DSL way of doing resource looping and inputs.

## First Pass

First impression was very positive!

Basic steps:

- `brew install pulumi`
- `pulumi new aws-go`
- Entered name of test stack such as `aws-vpc`.
- Copied the VPC snippet from their docs and then plugged in my own tag for naming, which by default wasn&#39;t included.
- Reproduced the example for `pulumi.String()`.[^string]

```go
package main

import (
	&#34;flag&#34;

	petname &#34;github.com/dustinkirkland/golang-petname&#34;
	&#34;github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/sdk/v4/go/aws/ec2&#34;
  &#34;github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi/config&#34;
)

var (
	words     = flag.Int(&#34;words&#34;, 2, &#34;The number of words in the pet name&#34;)
	separator = flag.String(&#34;separator&#34;, &#34;-&#34;, &#34;The separator between words in the pet name&#34;))

func main() {
	pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
		conf := config.New(ctx, &#34;&#34;)
		stage := conf.Require(&#34;stage&#34;)
		petname := petname.Generate(*words, *separator)
		_, err := ec2.NewVpc(ctx, stage, &amp;ec2.VpcArgs{
			CidrBlock: pulumi.String(&#34;10.0.0.0/16&#34;),
			Tags: pulumi.StringMap{
				&#34;Name&#34;: pulumi.String(strings.Join([]string{stage, petname}, &#34;-&#34;)),
			},
		})
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		return nil
	})
}
```

## Positive Observations

- Running `pulumi destroy` left the stack in the console for full plan history and auditing.
To remove the stack from the web you&#39;d run: `pulumi stack rm dev`.
This is similar to how terraform cloud workspaces work and gives confidence of easier auditing by default.
- The console experience and browser integration was beautifully done.
- `pulumi preview --emoji` provided a very clean and succint summary of changes.
- `pulumi up` also was very clean, and allowed a selection to expand the details as well.
- Browser for stack provides full metadata detail, resource breakdown, audit history, and more.

- The Pulumi docs for Azure DevOps were pretty solid!
Full detail and walk through.
As an experienced PowerShell developer, I was pleasantly suprised by quality PowerShell code that overall was structured well.[^powershell-build-script]

- Set some values via yaml easily by: `&#39;pulumi config set --path &#39;stage&#39; &#39;dev&#39;` which results in:

```yaml
config:
  mystack:stage: dev
  aws:region: myregion
```

This is then read via:

```go
conf := config.New(ctx, &#34;&#34;)
stage := conf.Require(&#34;stage&#34;)
```

## Things To Improve

- Missing the benefit of Terraform module registry.
- Pulumi Crosswalk sounds pretty awesome to help with this.
However, I wasn&#39;t able to find the equivalent of a &#34;crosswalk module library&#34; to browse so that part might be a future improvement.

This document link: [AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) | Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crosswalk/aws/vpc/) seemed great as a tutorial, but wasn&#39;t clear immediately on how I could use with Go.

I looked at the [aws ¬∑ pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/sdk/v4@v4.15.0/go/aws) but didn&#39;t see any equivalent to the documented `awsx` package shown from nodejs library.

Finally, found my answer.

&gt; Pulumi Crosswalk for AWS is currently supported only in Node.js (JavaScript or TypeScript) languages. Support for other languages, including Python, is on the future roadmap. [Pulumi Crosswalk for AWS | Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crosswalk/aws/#what-languages-are-supported)

I wish this was put as a big disclaimer right up at the top of the crosswalk section to ensure it was very clear.

[^string]: This feels very similar in style to the AWS SDK which doesn&#39;t allow just string values, but requires pointers to strings and thus wraps up the strings with expressions such as `aws.String(`.

[^powershell-build-script]: Subjective, but I noticed boolean values instead of switches, which would slightly simplify the build scripts, but is more of a &#34;nit&#34; than a critical issue. Using if blocks instead of switch might also clean things up, but overall the script was pretty well written, which seems rare in vendor provided PowerShell examples. üëè
