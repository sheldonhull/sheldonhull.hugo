# Cloudflare Analytics for Your Jamstack Site


A new alternative to Google Analytics if you want to keep things simple.

[Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics) seems promising.

I&#39;d probably have started with this if I was setting up my site from scratch.

The problem I have with adopting a tool like this is no basic import of metrics from Google Analytics means I&#39;d lose years of history.

Does the history matter signficantly? Not really for me. I just don&#39;t like losing out the entire history to see how things have improved over time.
