# Ventilation Systems


Got sucked into reading about ventilation systems in Europe.
There&#39;s mechanical and passive based ventilation.
I&#39;ve lived most of my adult life where central air systems are used, that it took me a day before I registered the oddity of:

- no ceiling vents
- the constant whoosh of air in the bathroom[^1]
- the seeming airflow from about the full length doors.

While I&#39;m betting this would be a subpar experience in summer compared to what we have in Texas, during less heat induced times it&#39;s great as the house never feels stale with this constant air circulation.

I find things like this some of the most interesting when traveling, as things you take for granted are done so differently across the world.

- A great friend/family member who really cares.
- Someone who happens to love HVAC &amp; ventilation systems.
