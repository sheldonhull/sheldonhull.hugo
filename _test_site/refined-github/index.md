# Refined Github



After using this for a while, I figured I&#39;d add this to my my &#34;cool-tools&#34; list.

[![refined-github/refined-github - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/refined-github/refined-github.svg)](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github)

The main features I&#39;ve found useful:

- Use keyboard to flip straight to code review with approve/reject focused.
- Highlight the code most recently changed in the browser.

There&#39;s a whole list on the repo page of small usability tweaks for those living in GitHub, for example [Repositories Tweaks](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github#repositories).

Give it a try!
