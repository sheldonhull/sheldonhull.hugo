The palace, a monument to excess, was overwhelming. The crowds in the rooms were intense, and as I shuffled for 15 minutes elbow to elbow with crowds, it was hard for me to enjoy the rooms.

There was a long line initially, but thankfully, that was the wrong one. We found a much shorter line, which was a relief even though we were a bit late. The journey involved an hour-long train ride, followed by a 12-minute walk to the B line. Then, we hopped onto line C, which had 13 stops, roughly a half-hour ride. Once there, our first stop, after a necessary bathroom break, was King Louis XIV‚Äôs room, well, more accurately, rooms. After navigating through what seemed like a bajillion of them, we arrived at the Hall of Mirrors. This stunning hallway connects his suite to the queen‚Äôs suite. Post this royal expedition, we attempted to dine at a creperie called La Place, but it was fully occupied, so no luck there. Instead, we found another spot, the name of which escapes me at the moment, sorry! This place had a relaxing atmosphere and served some pretty good crepes at remarkably cheap prices, a large crepe for just 4 euros! After our meal, we strolled back to the gardens, which were free to enter. While the girls played, I managed to snap some good photos and even shot some decent videos, despite the freezing cold. It was a nice way to expend some energy. Finally, we began our journey back. We took the C line to Ch√¢telet-Les Halles, then switched to the D line. Two stops later, we arrived at Stade de France, followed by a short 5-minute walk back home. And that‚Äôs where we are now. Please like and subscribe.3 A pint of cider makes any day wonderful.

Its layout was beautiful, reminding me of a minimalist, modern style with plenty of space that could have been used for caf√© tables, but was instead just empty. A mosaic-style ceiling gave the impression of a small cathedral. The two people sitting at the only available seats saw Karis and me, saw our desire to sit and order something, and gracefully gave up their seats, giving us a wonderful opportunity to sit. As we perused the selection, we found that the apple-based treat and her chocolate croissant were some of the best we‚Äôve ever had.

In fact, if this hadn‚Äôt been a dedicated gluten-free bakery, I would have seriously doubted that what I was eating was gluten-free.

At first, I thought it was a recording, but it turns out that the voices I was hearing were actually the priest and some nuns singing a beautiful song that echoed throughout the room. The scale is really hard to visualize, even with the video I‚Äôve taken. You feel dwarfed in that room where the ceiling feels 100 feet high, and once you go to the center of the room and you look up, the dome of the basilica rises so far above you that it‚Äôs daunting. The Basilica‚Äôs height is over 200 meters above the site Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica, Sacred Heart of Montmartre, often simply Sacr√©-C≈ìur. It‚Äôs dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. I‚Äôm looking at the facts related to it on Wikipedia Apparently, the plan to build the church was started on September 4th, 1870. Interestingly enough, in reading Wikipedia, construction costs estimated at 7 million francs were expended before any above-ground structure became visible. Also interesting was that it was not named a historical monument until 2022. The total height of the dome is over 270 feet. This is pretty amazing, and inside the place, you can hear the murmur of voices and steps, but there is a reverence by all the people sitting. There‚Äôs a separation from the people traveling through it on the sides, who are asked to be quiet, from the people in the middle. They ask not to take pictures in the middle section to respect and honor people who are in prayer.

Without the relationship and without action of love towards the people in the community and around them, then this place, as impressive as it seems to us, is just but a noise to God. However, if the people here are using this as a place of worship and then taking that out into the world, then this can be a place that helps us draw closer to God and inspires a sense of reverence.\" It‚Äôs important to remember that the artistry of the people, the creativity of its builders, is something we should value. However, as a religious monument, it‚Äôs important to understand that God is not impressed by man‚Äôs creation. While it may help instill a sense of reverence in us, the love and action towards our fellow man is what our faith is derived from. God could care less whether we are in a park, a tent, a hovel, a ministry full of drug addicts reaching out for Jesus, or the most beautiful basilica in Europe. What matters is the hearts turned in reverence and adoration to Him. We enjoyed this time as we prayed, and we left. As we left, we took plenty of pictures and video. Karis got an extra point in the imaginary game we‚Äôve been having since she watched and found a rat just sitting out, brazen in the middle of some grass behind a fence, chowing down on somebody‚Äôs thrown away meal.

Was a great chance to line up a quick shot walking down an alley. Any images feel silly trying to capture the scale of this building. It really is one of those things you have to see in person to feel. I can't wait to hit up the Saint George one in Rome which just finished the 250+ years of construction this week. Being on top of the hill gives a beautiful view of Paris. The Christmas lights were out and shining. The Sunday we went this square was packed edge to edge with painters offering portraits. Turns out this area is a hub of tourist activity due to the church. We were lucky hitting up at night how quiet and enjoyable it was. It's hard to capture, but the feeling I got from the lights was a bit of an oasis of light in the middle of the street. Yes, others were lit up, but overall they did a really good job making it \"pop\". Karis posing outside Copains. Delighted at the hot chocolate, caramel, whipcream, and a little shot of coffee.

At a bus stop, I caught my first glimpse of the Eiffel Tower, that amazing landmark. We got closer, went around it, and let me tell you, it was amazing. We saw the Eiffel Tower from the top, and I got it all on the GoPro, but everything looks tiny through it, still it was cool. Then as it got dark and the lights went on, the Eiffel Tower became ten times more amazing, all sparkly and bright. Later at a bridge - not the most famous but still famous, and a beautiful carousel nearby - we didn‚Äôt go on, but it sure was fun to look at. My mom took lots of pictures. But yeah, Jasper the cat was there when we got back at like 6 or 7 pm, and he‚Äôs just the best, he‚Äôs my new stuffy. Ella‚Äôs Entry: There were more than ten parakeets outside our window this morning! Then last night, we went to the Gellato Shop - a different one than before. Oh, and we also went to a park dad stopped at for a few minutes on our walk home, at night. They had ropes and a big net. Climbed it like there was no tomorrow. Saw another rat. And there was this trash can while we were walking and out of nowhere, a whole bunch of rats scurried off, yuck! I have a new stuffy bat. That‚Äôs all for me.

I‚Äôll do some video later as I get the time (the internet is painfully slow at this location). Our worst mistake. Assumed the flavors would be the same. Wrong. The spice was almost pure cumin, no spice at all. The salsa tasted like tomato paste. It was painful and no one liked it. Sarah took this on the run as we were looking for restrooms for the kids. Nice shot! Me pretending to like Sarah after 200+ steps on the Eiffel Tower. Took me a while to feel my legs and forgive her for no elevator tickets. Karsten took this one as well. Ella hanging out at a park they found. I love this shot. Karsten took this image and post-processed. Was pretty proud of it, so I made sure to include this. I think he's getting the hang of it! Ella can't get enough of these. I've noticed that every paris park with any reasonable size has a carousel. Googling this says the French claim the invention derived from Louis the XIV's jousting competitions. Karis on the nighttime carousel. The park across the sidewalk was dark and I could hear rats scurring through the bushes. Decided the carousel was a better options. Our digs. Been working this part of the trip, and that's me plugging away. With all the stress the kids have put me through, I have plenty of neck protection to help me out. Not sure why they are scaring kids with signs about Fairy's pinching your fingers, but ok. I was happy to get both smiling for this one, it's always the hardest when you get 2 siblings together and say smile. Eiffel Tower family portraits are a must if you are going to endure the pain of those stairs. Sarah opted for the pass that had elevators only after you get to the second level. That's some diabolical upselling. My legs hurt just walking up the subway steps the next day thinking about this climb. Once every generation comes a young man with a flamingo in his arms and a dream in his eyes. Found a \"sans gluten\" aka gluten-free Italian restaurant that was overpriced but pretty good. The Arc de Triomphe is an iconic landmark. It's a lot of fun to photograph due to the symmetry and repeated patterns. It's also a stair stepper from the first level of Hades.

I really liked how the light played with their shadows and managed to grab a quick shot. Karsten enjoying the night out. Kinder Eggs! I missed those. My parents gave these to us in Germany when we lived there. I made sure to pick some up for the kids and they've really had fun with them. Karis was going on 3-4 hours of sleep and major jet lag. This was in the morning before we finished the last train stop and made it to our destination. This is us after our flight, train ride, and figuring out where to go. We are all exhausted and short on patience, as I think you can tell from our overly tired teen ü§£. While the kids ate some crepes, a friendly Parisian drew this for Ella in the cafe and made her smile. Definitely better to see the Eiffel Tower at night. The kids thought this was hilarious. They aren't used to seeing the compromises made when space is so limited. This dog was leashed but out for some fresh air. I can't quite believe the eclair I'm eating from Noglu.

During my quick tour of New York, I had the best pizza (gluten free!) at Don Antonios. I paid for this with selling one my children to them, but it was worth it. The New York subway was suprising in it‚Äôs efficiency and speed. In contrast to the French trains I‚Äôve been taking (and will post on later), it rockets off, has bare metal everywhere, and feels like it just fits the New York sense of efficiency. Waiting on restrooms in lines was also a good taste of what was to come in Europe. New York is a remarkable city to visit, but I don‚Äôt see myself ever wanting to leave there.

Managing your Azure DevOps configuration, builds, and pipelines with Terraform or Pulumi is a far nicer way to keep things maintainable and scale up as more are added.

Reduce the overhead and focus on documenting core principles or concepts that would be useful in a wiki style format, but not log as much. Using Github Issues might work really well too, because you could post them to a log later in bulk, but otherwise the cli driven creation and kanban board approach would minimize the overhead. That would be cool too cause you could have bots run todos, stale items, and other cool things for you.

Knowing where the value is constructed is part of the static analysis the compiler performs. Bill said this is a really powerful feature that will probably impact future languages. When you see a pointer in the return value, this could be phrased ‚Äúshared up the callstack‚Äù. This means that the construction inside the function would be on the heap not the stack. If you are trying to access items further up on the stack, it requires pointers. Bill said what‚Äôs cool about this is the ability to access an item on the heap via this pointer, as if we were working with pointers to a stack value. It abstracts the machine level details away so we benefit from easy out of frame access to values with pointers. We don‚Äôt have to worry about where the location of the value being constructed is. Due to escape analysis, the compiler will determine the best place, but the reality is some items have to go to the heap, and the compiler is smart enough to help determine this. Why does this matter? Bill says that if performance matters, understanding the concepts matter because garbage collection and other latencies are impacted by these concepts. Can view escape analysis from compiler with: go build -gcflags -m=2. I tested this on one of my projects, and found that function complexity can prevent inlining, lots of escape to heap references and more. While not needed for basic build automation type helpers, I could see the value in scalable design for Go in examining this in more details. It‚Äôs almost like using SQL Server execution plans to optimize for higher performance. Takeaways Don‚Äôt hide the costIf we are doing construction to a variable, we use value construction. Avoid pointer semantic construction if not in the return. Example: // clear visible cost of the allocation by value construction and passing of pointer back up the call stack func createSomething() *something { u := something{ name: \"example\", } return \u0026u // \u003c--- This makes clear the cost and allocation back up the callstack. } // cost is obscured by construction being a pointer // and returning a value that is not clear to reader if value or pointer func createSomething()*something { u := \u0026something{ name: \"example\", } return u // \u003c--- Not good.

Used concurrent progressbar example from uiprogress project to test concurrent UI updates. My last concurrency test case was to launch many concurrent processes for a load test. This didn‚Äôt leverage goroutinues as typically used, since it was calling to an executable on the host machine. However, this provided a great use case for something I‚Äôve done before with DevOps oriented work and showed how to use concurrency as a blocking operation. Once the user was done with the test, ctrl+c was used to kill the active requests and the program exited. I need more practice with channels. I was only wanting error stdout content, and so didn‚Äôt have any need for receiving channel output back in a structured way. This is probably an atypical usage of concurrency, fitting for an external load test, but not internal Go code. Still found it pretty cool that I could spin up 500 processes at once, with far less overhead than doing in PowerShell. Example Of Doing In PowerShell Doing this in PowerShell is far more compact, but not as performant. This is a good example of the different in using Go for adhoc tasks.

Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks. 1 ‚Ä¶ Dapr codifies the best practices for building microservice applications into open, independent building blocks that enable you to build portable applications with the language and framework of your choice. Each building block is completely independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application. From this, it sounds like Dapr helps solve issues by abstracting the ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù away from the business logic. Rather than focusing on the implementation level concern of how to talk from service to service, Dapr can help with this. Instead of relying on provider specific key-value store, such as AWS SSM Parameter store, Dapr abstracts that too. It‚Äôs interesting as this concept of abstraction on a service level is something new to me. Good abstractions in software are hard but critical to maintainability long-term. Provider-level abstractions are something on an entirely different scale.

Digging into esoteric tomes of knowledge, the wizard discovered others have had similar issues when calling external processes using the legendary wizardry of os/exec.

Follow Steampipe On Twitter I‚Äôm seriously impressed. I built a project go-aws-ami-metrics last year to test out some Go that would iterate through instances and AMIs to build out aging information on the instances. I used it to help me work through how to use the AWS SDK to iterate through regions, instances, images, and more. In 15 mins I just solved the equivalent issue in a way that would benefit anyone on a team. My inner skeptic was cynical, thinking this abstraction would be problematic and I‚Äôd be better served by just sticking with the raw power of the SDK. It turns out this tool already is built on the SDK using the same underlying API calls I‚Äôd be writing from scratch. First example: DescribeImage This is the magic happening in the code. resp, err := svc.DescribeImages(\u0026ec2.DescribeImagesInput{ Owners: []*string{aws.String(\"self\")}, }) for _, image := range resp.Images { d.StreamListItem(ctx, image) } This is the same SDK I used, but instead of having to build out all the calls, there is a huge library of data already returned. req, publicImages := client.DescribeImagesRequest(\u0026ec2.DescribeImagesInput{ Filters: []*ec2.Filter{ { Name: aws.String(\"is-public\"), Values: []*string{aws.String(\"true\")}, }, }, }, ) There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Instead of iterating through regions, accounts, and more, Steampipe allows this in plain old SQL. Query The Cloud For example, to gather: EC2 Instances that use AWS Owned Images and use an image that created greater than n period and want the aging in days SELECT ec2.instance_id, ami.name, ami.image_id, ami.state, ami.image_location, ami.creation_date, extract('day' FROM now()) - extract('day' FROM ami.creation_date) AS creation_age, ami.public, ami.root_device_name FROM aws_ec2_ami_shared AS ami INNER JOIN aws_ec2_instance AS ec2 ON ami.image_id = ec2.image_id WHERE ami.owner_id = '137112412989' AND ami.creation_date \u003e now() - INTERVAL '4 week' There are plugins for GitHub, Azure, AWS, and many more. You can even do cross-provider calls. Imagine wanting to query a tagged instance and pulling the tag of the work item that approved this release. Join this data with Jira, find all associated users involved with the original request, and you now have an idea of the possibility of cross-provider data Steampipe could simplify. Stiching this together is complicated. It would involve at least 2 SDK‚Äôs and their unique implementation. I feel this is like Terraform for Cloud metadata, a way to provide a consistent experience with syntax that is comfortable to many, without the need to deal with provider specific quirks.

Builds a docker container and uploads to Docker Hub, for a generic tool, but includes embedded AWS credentials for a linter in it. Uses IAM long-lived keys to use a tool to generate infrastructure as code and commits these to the repository due to not excluding the .env file in the .gitignore. Uses IAM access keys that are highly privileged as the easy path (over narrowing permission scope), puts these in a vendor site that integrates with AWS, and forgets about it.

Since it still requires editing the main file to extend and point to another file, I‚Äôve found a single file simpler to maintain. Disable parallel operation for anything formatting files or possibly not thread safe. While parallel operation seems great, most of the pre-commit tasks should run quickly, and formatting and linting files at the same time could lead to conflicts or problems. Use parallel operation for separate language test runs perhaps, like running Python tests and Go tests since those shouldn‚Äôt conflict. piped: true is useful but hides the underlying tasks in the summary, so I suggest avoid unless you have tasks that really should feed into each other step by step. In this case, maybe you should have this just be part of your task run, such as mage lint fmt rather than two separate pre-commit hooks.

Feature Request: Consider 1-3 private workspaces for the free tier, with maybe 1 active at a time like the Codespaces beta as a good route towards adopting for private projects and testing. A limited private count would help adoption for those wanting to experiment with it for small private projects. I‚Äôd guess it might help make the jump to paid easier as it would allow the adoption of workflow in private and public projects.

I agree you fix it! I believe in continual refactoring and improvement, applying Site Reliability Engineering principles. Don‚Äôt kick the can down the street. Own it! For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL. Agree, it‚Äôs a solid start and often can be done if you are working in a non-engineer role to bring value immediately to your company. Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it. A caveat: a company should invest in the development of their employees, so try to leverage those benefits first. If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it‚Äôs time to move on. If this is a routine occurrence, heck yes. Sometimes you can‚Äôt help but run into politics. I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour. I‚Äôd rather spend time with kids, family, or friends. Agreed. On this topic, companies shouldn‚Äôt schedule team/company events in employees‚Äô off time. Schedule it during work hours. Don‚Äôt impact their family. The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault. You better believe I would‚Äôve walked over fire for her. 100% agree. My first week at one of my roles, I broke internalization and required the team to deploy a hotfix to clients overseas. Release manager protected me during calls and said we had a fix in place. No blame. I stayed 7 years and would have done almost anything for that release manager. **** those devops guys and gals are**** smart. At least those mofos get paid though. üòä We are making it up just like anyone else, but have to have flexibility in learning and change due to the wide range of things to learn. Despite focusing on a role in Backend Engineering now, I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to have worked in a Development Operations team and see growth with my ability to handle pressure, cross-functional communication, and wide range of technology exposure. AWS is hard. Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows. Why? Because I eventually worked in Linux. So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch. True. I wish I had started early. There is a career in purely Windows-based development, but I‚Äôd tell anyone starting out, it‚Äôs better to start with Linux as a choice if possible. It feels so much simpler overall than Windows with all its API-based management, registry, and lots of complexity overall. I don‚Äôt know why I siked myself out for so long. Linux feels natural as I‚Äôm immersed in it more. I‚Äôve learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data. Agreed. My inner geek want to play with ML. My engineer side questions the value for ML in normal enterprise work.

In my experience, the documentation I‚Äôve written hasn‚Äôt brought the value and recognization I thought it would, if the culture doesn‚Äôt prize this. I still write \u0026 blog, but unless the work culture supports reading first then meeting on something, I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs not given the priority it deserves. The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. ****, I said it. Fight me. I started with dynamic languages. Having started with Go in the last year, I‚Äôm finding a happy medium, and seeing that it presents a good development experience. I‚Äôd lean towards something like Go now, even for automation oriented work when possible.

This is straight outta their Github repo with the benefit of some tagging. $Queries += [ordered]@{ 'host' ='tcp:localhost,1433' 'username' =$UserName 'password' = $Password 'connector' ='adodbapi' 'driver' = 'SQL Server' 'database' = 'master' 'tags' = @( \"aws_account_alias:$AWSAccountAlias\" \"sql_instance:$SqlInstance\" \"stage:$stage\" ) } Using += for Collections Using += is a bit of an anti-pattern for high performance PowerShell, but it works great for something like this that‚Äôs ad-hoc and needs to be simple. For high performance needs, try using something like $list = [Systems.Collections.Generic.List[pscustomobject]]:new() for example. This can then allow you to use the $list.Add([pscustomobject]@{} to add items. A bit more complex, but very powerful and performance, with the benefit of stronger data typing. This one is a good example of the custom query format that Datadog supports, but honestly I found pretty confusing in their docs until I bumbled my way through a few iterations. $Queries += [ordered]@{ # description: Not Used by Datadog, but helpful to reading the yaml, be kind to those folks! 'description' = 'Get Count of Databases on Server' 'host' ='tcp:localhost,1433' 'username' = $UserName 'database' = 'master' 'password' = $Password 'connector' ='adodbapi' 'driver' = 'SQL Server' 'min_collection_interval' = [timespan]::FromHours(1).TotalSeconds 'command_timeout' = 120 'custom_queries' = @( [ordered]@{ 'query' = \"select count(name) from sys.databases as d where d.Name not in ('master', 'msdb', 'model', 'tempdb')\" 'columns' = @( [ordered]@{ 'name' = 'instance.database_count' 'type' = 'gauge' 'tags' = @( \"aws_account_alias:$AWSAccountAlias\" \"sql_instance:$SqlInstance\" \"stage:$stage\" ) } ) } ) } Let me do a quick breakdown, in case you aren‚Äôt as familiar with this type of syntax in PowerShell. $Queries += takes whatever existing object we have and replaces it with the current object + the new object. This is why it‚Äôs not performant for large scale work as it‚Äôs basically creating a whole new copy of the collection with your new addition. Next, I‚Äôm using [ordered] instead of [pscustomobject] which in effect does the same thing, but ensures I‚Äôm not having all my properties randomly sorted each time. Makes things a little easier to review. This is a shorthand syntax for what would be a much longer tedious process using New-Object and Add-Member. Custom queries is a list, so I cast it with @() format, which tells PowerShell to expect a list. This helps json/yaml conversion be correct even if you have just a single entry. You can be more explicit if you want, like [pscustomobject[]]@() but since PowerShell ignores you mostly on trying to be type specific, it‚Äôs not worth it.

Now that this disclaimer is out of the way, I‚Äôve run into scenarios where you can have a bucket with a large amount of data such as databases which would be good to do some cleanup on before you migrate to newly managed backups. In my case, I‚Äôve run into 50TB of old backups due to tooling issues that prevented cleanup from being successful. The backup tooling stored a sqlite database in one subdirectory and in another directory the actual backups. I preferred at this point to only perform the lifecycle cleanup on the backup files, while leaving the sqlite file alone.

I modified this example to support providing multiple key prefixes.

If you try to run a loop and create one lifecycle policy for each Write-S3LifecycleConfiguration command, it only kept what last ran.

This is particularly useful with Terraform dependencies, which I consider notoriously difficult to keep updated. Instead of needing to use ranges for modules, you can start specifying exact versions and this GitHub app will automatically check for updates periodically and submit version bumps. Why?

My background is also heavily focused in relational databases and set based work, so I‚Äôm realizing as I study more programming paradigms seperate from any database involvement, that it‚Äôs a fundamental difference in the way a database developer and a normal developer writing backend code look at this. Rather than declarative based syntax, you need to focus a lot more on iterating through collections and manipulating these. As I explored my assumptions, I found that even in .NET Linq expressions are abstracting the same basic concept of loops and iterations away for simpler syntax, but not fundamentally doing true set selections. In fact, in some cases I‚Äôve read that Linq performance is often worse than a simple loop (see this interesting stack overflow answer) The catch to this is that the Linq expression might be more maintainable in an enterprise environment at the cost of some degraded performance (excluding some scenarios like deferred execution). For example, in PowerShell, you can work with arrays in a multitude of ways. $array[4..10] | ForEach-Object {} # or foreach($item in $array[$start..$end]){} This syntactic sugar provides brevity, but as two ways among many I can think of this does add such a variety of ways and performance considerations.

Tour On Go says it well with: An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays. For instance, I tried to think of what I would do to scale performance on a larger array, so I used a pointer to my int array. However, I was using a slice. This means that using a pointer wasn‚Äôt valid. This is because whenever I pass the slice it is a pass by reference already, unlike many of the other types. newCollection := GetSubSelection(\u0026arr,2,3) func GetSubSelection(arr *[]int){ ...

No, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù. It‚Äôs different. Simple cli bash scripting is great for many things (thus prior article about Improving development workflow Task which uses shell syntax).

I‚Äôd say that for things such as exporting pipelines to Excel, and other ‚Äúautomation‚Äù actions it‚Äôs far more work in Go.

The thing is, not every environment will always have PowerShell, so I‚Äôve wanted to experiment with minimalistic task framework for intuitive local usage in a project when the tooling doesn‚Äôt need to be complex. While InvokeBuild is incredibly flexible and intuitive, there is an expectation of familarity with PowerShell to fully leverage. If you want a robust framework, I haven‚Äôt found anything better. Highly recommend examining if you are comfortable with PowerShell. You can generate VSCode tasks from your defined scripts and more. InvokeBuild \u0026 Psake aren‚Äôt great for beginners just needing to run some tooling quickly in my experience. The power comes with additional load for those not experienced in PowerShell. If you are needing to interact with AWS.Tools SDK, complete complex tasks such as generating objects from parsing AST (Abstract Syntax Trees) and other, then I‚Äôd lead towards InvokeBuild. However, if you need to initialize some local dependencies, run a linting check, format your code, get the latest from main branch and rebase, and other tasks that are common what option do you have to get up and running more quickly on this?

Primarily, I wanted 2 main things from my next step: Expand my horizons with a language that approached things differently than what I‚Äôm used to, forcing me to solve problems in a new way, not just a simple syntax shift. Try something that was more strictly typed and opinionated to help align my next development to be less ‚Äúadhoc‚Äù but more robust. Some additional perks would be: choosing a language that made me more competitive in the market (so choosing low adoption languages), immersed me more in Linux while still supporting cross platform work, and additionally supported quick adhoc tooling to be able to deliver small portable tooling to help support a DevOps culture.

By default, most of the time it was easier to use a dedicated IAM credential setup for the purpose. However, as I‚Äôve wanted to run some scripts across multiple accounts, the need to simplify by assuming a role has been more important. It‚Äôs also a better practice than having to manage multiple key rotations in all accounts. First, as I‚Äôve had the need to work with more tooling, I‚Äôm not using the SDK encrypted json file. Instead, I‚Äôm leveraging the ~/.aws/credentials profile in the standard ini format to ensure my tooling (docker included) can pull credentials correctly. Configure your file in the standard format. Setup a [default] profile in your credentials manually or through Initialize-AWSDefaultConfiguration -ProfileName 'my-source-profile-name' -Region 'us-east-1' -ProfileLocation ~/.aws/credentials. If you don‚Äôt set this, you‚Äôll need to modify the examples provided to include the source profilename. Next, ensure you provide the correct Account Number for the role you are trying to assume, while the MFA number is going to come from the ‚Äúhome‚Äù account you setup.

The consistency of app placement makes finding things to run quick, whereas in Windows, finding the app can be a beast at times. Think about this from a new Windows developer perspective. Go to Program Files (x86), or Program Files, but some go into AppData, and then settings in ProgramData, but sometimes that program prefers to put some of the configuration data in the Program directory and sometimes in ProgramData‚Ä¶. unless they want to put it in AppData‚Ä¶. and then Local/Roaming etc. It gets really really confusing quick. That‚Äôs why tools like Everything are so helpful! Docker startup is üöÄ FAST. I‚Äôm talking about an update for Docker, and install restart and in a few seconds it‚Äôs back up and running. I‚Äôve been so used to it being minutes on Windows. Mounted drive performance isn‚Äôt great, but neither is it on Windows. I love Chocolatey \u0026 Scoop on Windows, but I‚Äôm seeing some advantages to a central repository containing all the packages, instead of each package being the responsibility of maintainers to keep up to date. This makes the contribution phase much more difficult in Chocolatey. I‚Äôve written very complex Choco packages for my company, but haven‚Äôt yet setup a community one, whereas Brew, Scoop, and others have a central repository that you can easily submit a push request to with improvements or new additions without having to manage the autorefresh of the packages. A minor, but important distinction to me, as the ease of contributing must be there for more people to engage in it. Not having Windows as my OS has helped me go cold turkey as much as possible on running more workloads in Docker. Visual Studio Docker workspaces are absolutely incredible, and paired with a good tool like InvokeBuild with PowerShell, you have a stellar setup than can easily bootstrap itself on a new machine with ease.

When you write the feature files to work with Cucumber, you write them in Gherkin. Gherkin is supported for automated testing in many scripting languages.

By distributed I meant that instead of containing all the documentation in a single ‚Äúwiki‚Äù style repo, I wanted to grab documentation from the repositories I choose and render it. This would allow the documentation related to being contained in the repository it is related to. For instance, what if I wanted to render the documentation in the following structure: ** General Documentation** taco-ops-runbook ---\u003e building-tacos --------\u003e topic.adoc ---\u003e eating-tacos --------\u003e topic.adoc ---\u003e taco-policies --------\u003e topic.adoc ---\u003e taco-as-code --------\u003e topic.adoc ** Repo Oriented Documentation** github-repos ---\u003e taco-migration --------\u003e category-1 ------------\u003e topic.adoc ------------\u003e topic.adoc --------\u003e category-2 ------------\u003e topic.adoc ------------\u003e topic.adoc ---\u003e taco-monitoring --------\u003e category-1 ------------\u003e topic.adoc ------------\u003e topic.adoc --------\u003e category-2 ------------\u003e topic.adoc ------------\u003e topic.adoc The only current solution found was Antora. Antora is very promising and great for more disciplined documentation approaches by software development teams. The limitation I faced was complexity and rigidity in structure. For Antora to generate a beautiful documentation site, you have to ensure the documentation is structured in a much more complex format. For example, the docs might be under docs/modules/ROOT/pages/doc.adoc and have a nav.adoc file as well.

It‚Äôs a bit tedious and even with running scripts to install (or in my case I wrapped up with Chocolatey), it‚Äôs still a lot of things you need, including possibly a reboot if missing some .net dependencies. The normal solution is to leverage more localdb for quickly deploying and isolating the database. This has its own set of challenges that personally I like to avoid. Localdb is more isolated, but it‚Äôs not truly like running a local SQL Server standard edition, and debugging permissions, sharing, and other things can with its own set of steps to work through. I‚Äôve seen it common for many devs to just avoid these issues and run a local SQL Server installation to just simplify and work with SQL Server as it‚Äôs expected to be. I‚Äôd explored Docker SQL Server containers in the past, but one big issue for adoption to me was the issues I had mounting the local Windows folders to the Linux based container. ‚ùì Why is this important?

Yes. But just because there is a library someone created to give you some of these features, are the languages themselves first class data exploration languages, especially for adhoc and exploratory work. I think most would agree: no. To be very clear, I know there are possibilities, such as the newer Azure Data Studio powershell notebook feature, and likely other modules that can help with exploration. What I‚Äôm trying to be clear about is that those are all exceptions to the rule, whereas exploration in Python is a first class citizen from the start. (coming from a dedicated PowerShell addict üòÅ) Traditionally, I‚Äôve used Azure Data Studio or SQL Management Studio and run individually queries in a large sql script to explore and manipulate the data. However, once you start wanting to pivot, aggregate, sum, and do various other experimental actions, T-SQL can be over complicated to do this for that adhoc work. Just because you can do unpivot doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a smarter use of time than using a pivot table in Excel for adhoc work (as much as it pains me to say). Azure Data Studio Azure data studio is making great progress with SQL Server based notebooks, which I highly recommend checking out. It‚Äôs still in its infancy. So while it‚Äôs pretty useful for basics, if you want to stick with a scripted approach to explore, python will be superior. Just recently PowerShell based code cells are available too, I believe. However, even better than playing around with data in an Excel sheet, what if you wanted to stay in your programmatic script and start slicing and dicing the data coming back, molding into ‚Äútidy data‚Äù for what you want to analyze? PowerShell and .NET don‚Äôt have the intuitive and experimental data exploration capabilities that have existed for a long time in the Python libraries. They can easily manipulate, group, mold and visualize the data with minimal effort.

This will have all the artifacts that Terraform produces (such as the state file) just sit in your local directory. In retrospect, Terraform Cloud intermixed with getting up and running as a new user might add more complication than required. In technical documentation, there is a difference between a tutorial and a getting started. The getting started here is going to focus just on getting up and running, not on all the concepts about infrastructure as code. I found that just doing it the first time was the hardest thing. Terminology about modules and re-usability at the beginning of my efforts with Terraform went straight over my head as I couldn‚Äôt fully wrap my understanding around how it would work. Now that I‚Äôve gotten a lot more experience with Terraform for various projects, I‚Äôve got some personal ‚Äúbest-practices‚Äù that I‚Äôve found as well as insight from the community.

IMO re-usability of Terraform provides itself to a better team collaborative experience. Terraform‚Äôs preview of changes is more intuitive to me. Less nervous to deploy stuff.

It will be the first file you create. Create provider.tf Create terraform.auto.tfvars Note that if you try to create this file with the terraform.tfvars name, it won‚Äôt work if using Terraform Cloud, as tfvars get generated dynamically from the variables setup in the Cloud workspace. Create variables.tf which is going to house all the input variables we want to declare. Create iam.tf which will provide a nice low risk resource to create that will show you how to use string interpolation for dynamic names in the most simple way, as well as the way to leverage EOT syntax to easily escape mutliline strings. However, if you see yourself doing this constantly, you might reevaluate your approach to ensure you are using objects and properties as much as possible and not just strings. HCL Multiline String Syntax If you use \u003c\u003c-EOT you get a nice little benefit that‚Äôs not well documented. The - means it strings buffering whitespace for the following lines. This can allow you to keep your content indented and if you preface the first line with 6 spaces, then all the following lines trim 6 spaces as well to allow you to avoid a bunch of difficult to read string blocks. You‚Äôll likely want to use a workspace with Terraform to organize this work, so instead of using the default, use the command terraform workspace new qa Terraform should select this new workspace by default. You can list the current workspaces using terraform workspace list and then select another one later if you wish by running terraform workspace select qa. Terraform Workspace Naming Personally, I‚Äôd recommend to not drive much of your naming or other configuration based on the workspace name, and instead use variables. Terraform Cloud behavior with trying to use workspace names at the time of this post was not what I expected, so I ended up removing my dependency on workspace names being important for the configuration. See GitHub Issue Instead, I use it as metadata only to organize the workspaces, not try to build configuration based heavily on using workspace name.

This means you‚Äôll be able to run the apply directly on your machine instead of running it from the remote location. Running remote is great, but for this to work you need to edit your Terraform remote cloud workspace and add the AWS access keys, as the job is actually running in the remote context and not using your local machine credentials. Terraform Cloud Credentials My preferred solution for this is to setup another Terraform workspace to create the credentials and then call this datasource to provide me with access instead of having to configure environment variables per workspace. This is a more advanced operation and not required on your first go-round, but keep it in mind as you scale up to managing many workspaces later on. Connecting your git repository to your Terraform workspace can also be done for automatically planning on commit. This forces changes to come through your git commits instead of being able to run locally, which can be great for ensuring source control truly is the equivalent of your release when working with a team.

When you begin to have dozens to hundreds of servers that you might need to provide a quick fix, the last thing you want to do is RDP into each and perform some type of scripted action. AWS SSM (Systems Manager) provides a tremendous amount of functionality to help manage systems. It can perform tasks from running a script, installing an application, and other mundane administrative oriented tasks, to more complex state management, AMI automation, and other tasks that might go beyond the boundaries of virtual machine management. I‚Äôll probably be unpacking a few of these areas over the next few posts, since my world has been heavily focused on SSM usage in the last months, and leveraging it is a must for those working heavily with EC2.

Why does this PowerShell function‚Äôs default argument change value based on the use of . or \u0026 to invoke a command within it? Spent some digging into this and this is what I‚Äôve observed. First for clarity I do not believe that you should consider the NullString value the same as null in a basic comparison. Not sure why you need this either, as this is normally something I‚Äôd expect from c# development. You should be able to just use $null for most work in PowerShell. if($null -eq [System.Management.Automation.Language.NullString]::Value) { write-host \"`$null -eq [System.Management.Automation.Language.NullString]::Value\" } else { write-host \"`$null -ne [System.Management.Automation.Language.NullString]::Value\" } Secondly, the issue is not necessarily because of the call operator, ie \u0026. I believe instead you are dealing with underlying parameter binding coercion. Strong data typing is definitely a weak area for PowerShell, as even explicitly declared [int]$val could end up being set to a string type by PowerShell automatically in the next line when writing Write-Host $Val. To identify the underlying behavior, I used the Trace-Command function (Trace Command) . I changed the Use-Dot to just call the function as no write-host was needed to output the string. function Use-Ampersand { param( [string]$NullString = [System.Management.Automation.Language.NullString]::Value ) Format-Type $NullString \u0026cmd.exe /c exit 0 } The Format-Type I modified to also use what is considered a better practice of $null on the left, again due to type inference. function Format-Type($v= [System.Management.Automation.Language.NullString]::Value) { if ($null -eq $v) { '(null)' } else { $v.GetType().FullName } } To narrow down the issue with the data types, I used the following commands, though this is not where I found insight into the issue. Theyh when called directly worked the same. Trace-Command -Name TypeConversion -Expression { Format-Type $NullString} -PSHost Trace-Command -Name TypeConversion -Expression { Format-Type ([System.Management.Automation.Language.NullString]$NullString) } -PSHost However, when I ran the functions using TypeConversion tracing, it showed a difference in the conversions that likely explains some of your observed behavior.

Yes, you can use .NET data types like $List = [System.Collections.Generic.List[string]]::new() and some .NET typed rules can be enforced. However, PowerShell is not designed to be a strongly typed language like C#. Trying to approach it like this will result in a many difficulties.

Original New https://www.sheldonhull.com/blog/syncovery-arq https://www.sheldonhull.com/blog/syncovery-\u0026-arq-syncing-\u0026-backup What I wanted was a way to do a fuzzy match on the url to give me the best guess match, even if a few characters were different‚Ä¶ and I did not want to write this from scratch in the time I have. I found a reference to a great library called Communary.PASM and in PowerShell ran the install command: Install-Package Communary.PASM -scope currentuser The resulting adhoc script I created: The resulting matches were helpful in saving me a lot of time, finding partial matches when a few characters were off.

I had come across references to the Levenshtein algorithm when reading about string matching on Stack Overflow. I added that logic into my script, and watched paint dry while it ran. It wasn‚Äôt a good fit for my basic string matching. Learning more about string matching sounds interesting though as it seems to be a common occurrence in development, and I‚Äôm all for anything that lets me write less regex :-) For my rough purposes the Fuzzy match was the best fit, as most of the title was the same, just typically missing the end, or slight variance in the delimiter. I had other manual cleanup to do, but still, it was an interesting experiment. Gave me an appreciation for a consistent url naming schema, as migration to a new engine can be made very painful by changes in the naming of the posts. After some more digging, I decided to not worry about older post urls and mostly just focused on migrating any comments.

You get to work with database objects as in a new way, and begin manipulating and execute code in a much different approach than purely using T-SQL. Powershell offers a unique way to interact with prebuilt cmdlets, and you can explore leveraging .NET in powershell as well to have a powerful toolkit of options. This post is a not focused on a full walk-through, but instead to communicate some of the exploration I‚Äôve done, to help if you are beginning to explore more database automation and management. I plan on doing some basic walk-throughs for the powershell newbie in the future, so if you are confused about anything powershell related feel free to post a comment and I‚Äôll add it to my list of stuff to walk through.

You can directly invoke the SMO dlls and access the methods, properties, and extensibility this offers. This requires more .NET knowledge as you would be directly working with the SMO namespace, in a way that is almost the same as what you code in C#. The other approach is to leverage cmdlets. The cmdlets try to abstract away a lot of the complexities that working directly with the SMO namespace for ease of use and automation, and to simplify the process for those not as comfortable with coding in C# or directly leverage the SMO namespace in C# If purely focused on automation and little experience working with .NET then cmdlet‚Äôs will be by far the way to go. There is a serious learning curve in working with .NET directly vs prebuilt cmdlets. If desiring to expand your .NET knowledge, as well find that the prebuilt cmdlets don‚Äôt offer the behavior you are trying to achieve, then exploring the SMO namespace for directly invoking the methods and accessing properties can be valuable. The learning curve is more intense, so just be prepared for that if you are new to working with .NET directly in Powershell.

However, by opening SSMS up, right clicking, and launching the powershell window you‚Äôll be able to easily find the correct path to get the server level object. This allows you to leverage default methods in powershell like Get-ChildItem for iterating through objects. It treats the navigated SQL server path basically as a ‚Äúfile structure‚Äù allowing some interesting actions to be performed. One of these is a different approach to killing connections to a particular database. I found this great pointer by reading Killing SPIDS in Powershell from MidnightDBA Review that article for scripts focused on the termination of running spids. For an adhoc purpose the scripts MidnightDba provided are excellent and would allow quickly executing a kill script on connections from ssms \u003e powershell prompt. import-module -name sqlserver -disablenamechecking -verbose:$false -debug:$false CD SQLSERVER:\\SQL\\$ServerName -Verbose:$false -Debug:$false dir ' ?{$_.Name -eq \"$DatabaseName\"} ' %{$_.KillAllProcesses($DatabaseName)} I approach this with a different method in one final script using just the SMO server method KillAllProcesses. For some tasks I‚Äôve found it really helpful to have a simple 1 line kill statement thanks to MidnightDba‚Äôs pointer with the statements similar to the one above.

The memory profiler is more useful for someone focused on memory leaks which a SQL Dev isn‚Äôt as focused on for performance tuning. However, there are major benefits for diving into SQL Performance tuning with ANTS Performance profiler. I think I‚Äôd say this tool makes the epic category of my #cooltools kit. One of the most challenging processes for profiling activity is really identifying the single largest pain point. Trying to line up timings with the SQL plans and the application side by side is a big timesaver, and Red Gate improved ANTS Performance profiler to include the executed SQL with execution plans, making it a single stop to profile and get some useful information. There are other ways to get useful information, such as running Brent Ozar‚Äôs First Responder kit queries, Glenn Berry‚Äôs diagnostic queries, Query Store, and more. These tend to focus on server performance. As someone working in software development, there is something to be said for the simplicity of running the application and profiling the .NET and SQL performance in one captured \u0026 filtered result set. It‚Äôs a pretty quick way to immediately reduce noise and view a complete performance picture of the application. For performance profiling, Visual Studio has an option called Performance Profiler. I found my initial look at it to be positive, just really noisy. Disclaimer: As a member of the Friends of Red Gate program, I get to try out all the cool Red Gate tools. Lucky me! This doesn‚Äôt bias my reviews as I just like great tools that help me work with SQL server. This is one of them!

For more ‚Äúprofiling‚Äù and less performance analysis my favorite SQL profiling tool Devart‚Äôs DbForge Sql Profiler uses extended events and while amazing, isn‚Äôt as focused a tool for app and SQL performance analysis. If you haven‚Äôt checked that tool (free!) out I highly recommend it vs running profiler. It uses extended events and provides a nice experience in profiling and reviewing results. Super easy to use and very flexible for filtering/sorting/exporting. The only issues I have with it are the filtering setup is annoying, but tolerable to work with, and no execution plans that I‚Äôve been able to find built in, unlike running extended events in SSMS directly. Hopefully, Devart will recognize what an awesome tool they‚Äôve made and continue to push it forward. For just getting Entity framework and other ADO.net calls you can use intellitrace with the option for ADO.NET tracing enabled. I found this nice, but a little clunky to use compared to Linq Insight or other options mentioned. It‚Äôs included with visual studio so if only using periodically then this would be ok to work with. For a cleaner implementation of Entity Framework Profiling than the Intellitrace route use Devarts dbForge Linq Insight (I love this tool for cleaner profiling of ADO.NET activity when you aren‚Äôt focused on overall performance of the application) and are working in Visual studio.

Instead the task passes this information along as true or false. To properly handle this you‚Äôll need to pass in the value as a string then convert to boolean. I found a great start on working on this solution in a blog post by Rene which has more detail, so check it out. In addition, some reading on promiscuous types with powershell can be helpful to understand why special handling is needed with conversion.

Once you start increasing the size of the script blocks things can get hard to debug. I think the simpler the task to pass into the parallel tasks, the better. However, for some basic tasks that would benefit in parallel, you can definitely give it a shot. This task focused on iterating through a directory recursively and cleaning up each of the files by stripping out comments and blank lines. The following results were a simple example and interesting to compare. -------- Summary with PoshRSJobs-------- File Size: 9.59 MB Total Count: 4,600.00 Filepath: C:\\temp\\MyCleanedUpZip.zip Total Original Lines: 1221673 Total Lines: 1,201,746.00 Total Lines Saved: 21,959.00 TOTAL TIME TO RUN: 08:43 -------- Summary with Invoke-Parallel -------- File Size: 6.69 MB Total Count: 4,447.00 Filepath: C:\\temp\\MyCleanedUpZip.zip Total Original Lines: 1221436 Total Lines: 854,375.00 Total Lines Saved: 360,045.00 TOTAL TIME TO RUN: 05:22 PoshRSJobs seemed to approach creating the job list first, which took a long time, and then processed the output very quickly. Overall, this took longer for this type of task. Invoke-Parallel gave an almost instant response showing the progress bar with estimated time remaining, so for this type of job it actually ran faster. -------- Summary - Native ForEach -------- File Size: 6.69 MB Total Count: 4,621.00 Filepath: C:\\temp\\MyCleanedUpZip.zip Total Original Lines: 1227408 Total Lines: 861,600.00 Total Lines Saved: 365,808.00 TOTAL TIME TO RUN: 04:52 Surprising to me, the native foreach which was single threaded was faster. I believe in this case, the overhead of setting up the jobs was not worth parallel task processing. Since the task was a lot of small tasks, this probably wasn‚Äôt a good candidate for parallel tasks. Based on this small test case, I‚Äôd venture to look into parallel tasks when longer run times are involved, such as perhaps copying large files that aren‚Äôt oversaturating your IO. In this case, slow long copies would probably benefit from parallel tasks, while small text file copies as I showed wouldn‚Äôt.

However, I do also utilize some other toolkits. One competitor that I find has some , but I do dabble with some other toolkits (I know heresy :-) . One of the competitors that I find has some brilliant features, but many time lacks the refinement and ease of use of Redgate is Devart tools. The tools they offer are often really nice, and continually updated based on feedback. As a general rule, I‚Äôd say the Devart tools feel less ‚Äúrefined‚Äù in some areas, but then offer some really nice usability features that RG hasn‚Äôt yet implemented. Both have their place in my toolbelt depending on the need.Having just completed some very large data comparisons on views, generating over 15GB of network traffic in last few days, I‚Äôve been really impressed with the usability and output from Devart DbForge Data Compare. The performance seems great. I‚Äôve evaluated their schema compare before and found it fantastic for the price if I was strapped on a budget, but when able to pay for an overall more flexible and refined product I‚Äôd definitely choose SQL Compare. The differences are much smaller on the data compare tool though due to the much less complex nature of what it‚Äôs performing. I ran across a few features in that I thought would be great to mention for the team working on Data Compare to provide some enhanced functionality. Diff Report: They provide a fantastic option of outputting a diff report not only in CSV but in XLS format. The formatted report is much more usable than the CSV I get from RG Data compare because they format, and apply bold to the _S and _T cells that actually have a difference, enabling a much easier review process to find the diffs. This is far more usable for an end audience that might want to view differences in data detected on a table. I‚Äôve had the case to provide this report to analysts to look at differences. The typical use case of DBA‚Äôs syncing data from one database to another probably would just use the tool and never need this. My particular use case has found a better report output would have been a major benefit. Cached schema object definitions/mapping. They load up previous mappings so you can go and tweak without the need to refresh immediately. This would be nice when you are fine tuning the comparison results and keep needing to tweak to the figures. Other suggestions based on my recent work w/large table comparison. Since table size has a direct impact on the compare due to local caching of the data, consider providing a column that shows estimated \u0026 total space required for the comparison. This way if I compared a lot of small tables I‚Äôd see the rowcount/size (sp_spaceused) and then added a large table (3GB for example), I‚Äôd see the approx local storage and network transfer impact with total size of ‚Äú7GB total storage/transfer required‚Äù. If I setup a comparison on a view with custom key (due to no index on the view), and I drop and recreate the view for a new definition, the comparison options are not persisted (for example the custom key). I‚Äôm not sure if this is due to the underlying changes on the object_id and lack of clustered index for explicit mapping, but persisting this would be really nice when the columns used for key comparison still exist.

With the amount of context switching many developers do, it can be tough to remember how much time went to each project. With companies looking to track effort on sprints, hours on a client project, or (as in my case) just a dev wanting to better evaluate the productive use of time, this app fills some gaps that others don‚Äôt.For instance, I‚Äôve tried tools such as Toggl, and similar. I found them useful, but requiring a lot of diligence to work with. There is very little ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù categorization of time. Many of those tools are focused on a timer based approach that requires you to start and stop the timer. ManicTime approaches this differently. It has the typical stop watch, countdown, Pomodoro type functionality a time tracking tool might offer, but in addition to this it provides a captured timeline of activity with various forms of meta data to easily review and parse for categorization. This categorization of information can take the form of details such as: Development Personal Browsing or be specific based on user input such as Development, Reticulating Splines Personal, Contemplating Navel Project Manhattan, Task 666: Optimizing Nuclear Db Performance Manually entered information is a big driver for better tagging accuracy, but it expands this to allowing dynamic tags based on matching of applications, titles of documents, titles of web pages, calendar entries, and more. This offers a vast range of meta data captured on your system to generate more accurate allocation of your time. The only real negative to this is that it is not as simple as something like Toggle. However, with a little work, you can work an entire day and quickly recap at the end, categorizing your effort with very little fuss, and a high amount of accuracy. If you find yourself forgetting to hit the stop/start button on your time tracker and want to consider a better option for tracking your effort, then look no farther. I‚Äôve used this application over the last year and found a lot of value in it, figured I‚Äôd share a little on it, as it‚Äôs become on of the tools in my essentials pack. Disclaimer: I was provided with a license a while ago on this. This doesn‚Äôt impact my review, as I just like finding great tools to help devs have a better workflow.

Once you complete the update, you should run a check statement to ensure the Foreign Key is trusted. The difference in the check syntax is actually ridiculous‚Ä¶. This check would not ensure the actual existing rows are validated to ensure compliance with the Foreign Key constraint. alter table [dbo].[ChickenLiver] with check constraint [FK_EggDropSoup] This check would check the rows contained in the table for adherence to the foreign key relationship and only succeed if the FK was successfully validated.

Backup tuning: based on the size or specific database, use striped backups to enhance performance of backup jobs Enterprise edition, centrally manage and report on all backups across all servers. Override defaults by just including additional sql files in the InitialLoad configuration. Review the docs for the specifics. This means no need to loop and override like I did below now. Just deploy and your final steps can be setting up your default configuration options. Overall, great conversation and found out some really cool things about postcode commands that could be PowerShell driven. Definitely worth a further look if you want an alternative to the commonly used Ola Hallengren solution, and especially if you are wanting more table driven configuration options over the need to customize the commands in the agent steps. Updated 2017-01-25 While I think the minionware solution is pretty awesome, I think it takes more work for the value, and can be a bit confusing to correctly setup, vs the Ola Hallengren solution, esp since you can install this quickly with dbatools now. I‚Äôd lean towards Ola Hallengren for simple implementations, and consider MinionWare‚Äôs option if you are looking at their flexibility in the table based configuration. The learning curve seems higher to me, but more for those looking to tweak options a lot. Both are great solutions, just be aware MinionWare will require a little more digging to leverage it fully. Here‚Äôs my personal tweaked settings for deploying Minionware‚Äôs fantastic Reindex \u0026 Backup jobs. In the development environment, I wanted to have some scheduled jobs running to provide a safety net, as well ensure updated statistics, but there were a few default settings I wanted to adjust. In particular, I tweaked the default fill factor back to 0/100. I also installed all the objects to a new ‚Äúminion‚Äù database instead of in master, as I‚Äôm beginning to be a fan of isolating these type of maintenance jobs with logging to their own isolated database to easy portability. I also adjusted the default retain days on backups to 30. You can use this template as a guide to help you adjust the default backup settings to fit your environment a little better. There has been various forms of discussion on the adjustments of Fill Factor for example on the defaults. For more detailed explanation, see Brentozar.com post An Introduction to Fillfactor in SQL Server. For my usage, I wanted to leave the fill factors as default, so the install scripts flips these back to my desired settings. I also run the sp_config command to ensure backup compression is enabled to save some space. Maybe this will help you get up to speed if you want to try out this great solution, but tweak a few defaults. The ease of installation across multiple instances makes this my current favorite solution, followed by the fantastic Ola Hallengren solution.

BFD Eco is optimized for ease of use and fast results - it is deep enough for deeply sculpting drum sounds into all manner of shapes but is streamlined enough so that you won‚Äôt be overwhelmed with options. It has less detailed sounds than BFD2 and BFD3 but is much more light on system resources. BFD2 and BFD3 contain far more control over each aspect of each kit-piece as well as a configurable mixing engine with custom aux channels and much more.

I‚Äôve only touched on a small fraction of what it is supposed to be capable of, as I‚Äôm using a lot of the simple functionality to ‚Äúpaint‚Äù some rhythms. I was a little disappointed in the initial groove library as far as the single 6/8 groove test goes, as it felt more difficult to get a groove I liked than when I demoed Ez Drummer However, the flexibility in editing with the easy humanization and editing of the kit made up for this. I think the vast sound library of plugin packs is what is designed to expand this, so I‚Äôll probably cover some of those later to evaluate if they fill in the gap on providing a even larger variety of preset grooves for the wannabe composer. Note that the library is around 40GB for the initial load, so my isolated 6/8 groove test isn‚Äôt reflective of the rest of the available library. There is a lot to work with, and the expansion libraries seem to be pretty vast in number. Another area that would be awesome to enhance is providing something similar to ‚Äúsong finder‚Äù that EzDrummer 2 had, where a certain rhythm was tapped, and related matches found. EzDrummer 2 then provides something similar to Grooves where the song structures for verse, chorus, bridge, etc are laid out. I‚Äôm not partial to the format that EzDrummer used, I actually prefer the Groove library format of BFD3, but I sure would love seeing the search capability added to help quickly match grooves fitting the feel you are trying for. I‚Äôm pretty happy with the documentation and support, as they have a wide range of well made videos showing demonstrations on the product, how to use, etc. I look forward to incorporating this into my workflow and going through some more training videos to better understand a solid workflow, as I‚Äôm just starting to wrap my head around it, along with learning how to navigate Presonus Studio One Check out a trial if you want to give it a shot and post some feedback below on what you think.

This ensures something accidental doesn‚Äôt cause a mass deletion of files in your cloud storage. Zip versioning. If you want, you can version your backups with zipped contents Remote agent: If you are using another computer and syncing between them, you can setup the destination to have an agent so a zipped copy could be unzipped locally on the system by the agent, or file scans could be run locally by this agent instead of a remote agent having to do all the work. Run as a Service: I enabled to run as a service to ensure this always was running in the background Change Detection: You can setup near real-time file sync based on monitoring a folder.

They had a promotion that ended prematurely and they sent me a license as a goodwill gesture. Pretty fantastic service, and thanks to them for this.The documentation was a little sparse for the Windows setup, so I ran into some complications getting it to work. I have used TouchOSC, and had some difficulty with configuring it for windows. True to other‚Äôs postings, Lemur didn‚Äôt make this easier. Especially as a windows user, this is not a simple plug and play and go type of tool. If you are looking for that then you‚Äôd be better served by looking a Touchable, Conductr, or something similar that provides the full package. The difference is that Lemur offers a complete ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù environment for templates and automation. The sky is the limit. You can even have a single ipad controlling multiple computers based on the midi being mapped on one controller to various destinations. To get Lemur talking to Ableton Live (9.6), this is pretty much what worked for me after experimenting. Install Lemur Install Live Control 2 (basically just a set of template and automation scripts) Copy Live Control Template onto ipad (you can drag the file directly to the app in Itunes and hit sync) Install LoopBe. Note I tried rptMidi as well as LoopMidi, and this is the only one that worked without issue for me on Windows 10. Setup Lemur Daemon service as shown in screenshot. In ableton I setup as the following: If you drag a drum track into a channel and activate for recording, you can tap in the ‚Äúplay‚Äù tab and change ‚Äúkey‚Äù to ‚Äúdrum‚Äù. Then you can find the appropriate drum machine field by scrolling up or down. This got the initial setup going so I was able to drop a drum track in, and tap out a rhythm. I think I‚Äôm going to have invest more time into it to get what I want, so the jury is out for me as a casual user whether or not I‚Äôll be able to leverage this vs TouchOSC or touchable. It‚Äôs pretty powerful, just pretty complex! As a person primarily focused with Live for DAW and home recording/experimentation, I‚Äôm probably not going to leverage fully at this time like others would. If I gain some more traction with it, I‚Äôll try and post some more useful updates. Both TouchOSC and Lemur are designed for customization. If you want to get going with limited setup, look at Touchable, Conductr, or another similar to that.

We are not viewed in our frailty as we come before God to worship Him. We are not judged and condemned. He doesn‚Äôt look and tell us to come back when we are in a better place. Instead, just as the author of Hebrews writes (Heb 10), we can come with bold confidence, knowing that the way has been made for us in Christ, with us being viewed through the ‚Äúcurtain‚Äù of Christ. This is critical to every person wanting to draw closer to God, as without a realization that we should be able to approach with confidence and no judgement, we will hold back from fully diving into our relationship with Him. Hebrews 10:19-22 We have, then, my friends, complete freedom to go into the Most Holy Place by means of the death of Jesus. He opened for us a new way, a living way, through the curtain‚Äîthat is, through his own body. We have a great priest in charge of the house of God. So let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, with hearts that have been purified‚Ä¶ This has shaped my paradigm a lot. It‚Äôs hard for me to hear about others feeling unworthy in coming before God, like they have to get things together before coming to Him. This is so antithetical to the nature of God and to all of what we see Christ exemplifying in His life. Christ never demonstrated superiority, judgement against those who don‚Äôt demonstrate perfection. When He did bring out anger and judgement, it was focused on those who, in their misguided concepts of God, put barriers between God and His people. So, just a friendly reminder that you ‚ÄúLack for Nothing‚Äù. Cheers! disclaimer This is my first full production attempt with Ableton. I used Ableton Live Lite, with EzDrummer 2 to help generate some drums. Due to running out of time (and patience :-) I just wrapped this up instead of worrying about fine tuning every little piece. I‚Äôve got some errant vocal parts, guitar parts, and all, but hope you can just look past this. I ran out of time and ‚Ä¶. and patience to keep reworking. I actually am working on a series to help fellow worship leaders and musicians just getting into recording learn more about utilizing VSTs, DAW‚Äôs (like Ableton, Studio One 3), and more.

Recommendation - Prepare a Publish Profile file Setup Parameters for Build The arguments I choose to use were: (note the publishprofile parameter which wasn‚Äôt in older versions of SSDT) /t:Build /t:Publish /p:SqlPublishProfilePath=foobar.publish.xml\" /p:PublishScriptFileName=foobar.publish.sql /p:TargetDatabaseName=‚Äúfoobar‚Äù;TargetConnectionString=‚ÄúData Source=localhost;Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False‚Äù /p:PreBuildEvent= /p:PostBuildEvent= /p:VisualStudioVersion=14.0 The infuriating thing about working through this is that when it doesn‚Äôt find the publish profile, it defaults to the ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù settings, so in my case it kept trying to deploy the changes to a local database named the same thing as my project. Please don‚Äôt waste the same amount of time grinding your teeth at MSBuild as I did, and watch out for the paths to be correct! Make sure you have it set to copy the publish profile over or it will not exist and default to the deploy settings. When I omitted the VisualStudioVersion option, it had an error ‚Äúunable to connect to target server‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 2 days of work later I realized the version parameter was critical for it to use the right msbuild version and deploy. I didn‚Äôt go into more research on this, so feel free to comment if you more details on this.

This helps the system manage the log file more efficiently. New VLF‚Äôs are inactive \u0026 not used. Active VLF‚Äôs contain the log record activity and can‚Äôt be reused until they have been noted as available by SQL server. My seque based on the fun experience of giant log files. Note: In Brentozar Office Hours Brent talked about the common misconception of SIMPLE VS FULL logging. Most folks (guilty) think that SIMPLE reduces the amount of logging SQL server performs, thereby improving the overall performance. However, in a general sense this is a misconception. Logging, as previously discussed from my previous post on (101), is the core of SQL server, and required for transaction durability. The difference between SIMPLE and FULL is mostly to do with how the transaction log space is marked as available for reuse. SIMPLE: after data files are updated and the data file is now consistent with the changes the log has recorded, the transaction logs are now marked as free and available. FULL: all the transaction log records, even after hardened to the data file, are still used. This is what can cause the common issue of exponential log file growth with folks not aware of how it works. 300 GB log file on a small database due to now one watching? Been there? This is because the log file will keep appending the log entries overtime, without freeing up space in the existing transaction log, unless some action is taken to let SQL server know the transaction log file space is available for reuse. Marking the space as available is done by ensuring you have a solid backup solution in place that is continually backing up the transaction log in the backup set) thereby letting SQL server know that the transaction log has been backed up and space can be reused in the existing log file. The normal process would be to ensure you have a full backup, incremental backups, and transaction log backups running on a schedule.\u003e Under the full recovery model or bulk-logged recovery model, if the transaction log has not been backed up recently, backup might be what is preventing log truncation. If the log has never been backed up, you must create two log backups to permit the Database Engine to truncate the log to the point of the last backup. Truncating the log frees space for new log records. To keep the log from filling up again, take log backups frequently. MSDN Troubleshooting a Full Transaction Log My past experience was running into this challenge when performing a huge amount of bulk transactions. I ran the space out on a drive because the log files continued to grow with no backups on the log file running. The solution in my particular situation was to take a full backup, change the database recovery to Bulk-logged or SIMPLE, perform the massive changes, then get right back to full-recovery with backup. This helped ensure the log file growth didn‚Äôt keep escalating (in my case it was the appropriate action, but normally you want to design the size of the transactions to be smaller, and the backup strategy to be continual so you don‚Äôt run into this issue) ","date":"2016-01-08","objectID":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/transaction-logging--recovery-part-2/:2:0","series":null,"tags":["sql-server"],"title":"Transaction Logging \u0026 Recovery (part 2)","uri":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/transaction-logging--recovery-part-2/#virtual-log-files"},{"categories":null,"content":"Logging \u0026 Recovery Notes from SQL Server Logging, Recovery, and the Transaction Log (pluralsight) Paul Randal Going to share some key points I‚Äôve found helpful from taking the course by Paul Randal at pluralsight.

One of the most critical components to how SQL server works and provides the Durability in ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is the logging and recovery mechanisms. If log files didn‚Äôt exist we couldn‚Äôt guarantee after a crash the integrity of the database. This recovery process ensures after a crash even if the data file hasn‚Äôt be changed yet (after a checkpoint) that SQL server can reply all the transactions that had been performed and thereby recover to the consistent point, ensuring integrity. This is critical and why we know even with a crash that no transactions will be left ‚Äúhalfway‚Äù, as we‚Äôd require the transactions to be harden to the log file before SQL server would allow the data file to be changed. If this was done in the reverse order of writing to the data file, then if a crash happened, the log file might be out of sync, and you couldn‚Äôt reply actions that might not have been fully made to the log file as the data file and log file wouldn‚Äôt be in sync with the transactions noted. The logging \u0026 recovery mechanism is actually the backend architecture driving most of the disaster recovery options like Mirroring, Replication, Availability Groups and more. They each have different ways of handling/processing, but underneath, they all rely on utilizing the transaction logs. - Logging = the backbone of sql server.

If not explicitly stated, then an implicit transaction is gathered by SQL server in how it handles the action (when dealing with DML). For example, if we alter 2 tables, we could manually set a transaction for each, so if one fails, both were rolled back to the original state, allowing us to commit one table changes even if the other experienced a failure. If we combined both of these statements without defining a transaction then SQL server would imply a transaction, and this might result in a different behavior. For example: alter table foo alter table bar GO -- if foo failed, then both tables would not be changed, as the transaction itself failed on the other hand the statement below would be promised in SSMS as a batch separator and SQL server would have two separate transaction for each.

In the case that you are deploying an application or any set of tables/structure that might end up being used by someone else, describing your data model can be a really helpful resource to someone trying to query or implement some custom implementation against your data. This might be helping document some data structures for someone building a report, or even developers trying to leverage some of the data in a separate implementation. Understanding the data model as a dba/dev is important to being able to architect improvements as well, so I‚Äôve found that going through and diagramming some of the logical structures/groupings can be a tremendous benefit to better understanding a database that perhaps you didn‚Äôt architect from scratch, or has legacy results. Some positives I see: Forces a better understanding of how your data model is constructed Can help highlight weaknesses and flaws in your data model Can help explain the data model to folks who may not be living and breathing your business, so if terminology and fields sometimes are confusing on how things relate, the data model can help clarify some of these things.

Highly recommend the dbsophic product for a great utility to help save a lot of time in doing this comparison. This tool goes into my top SQL server performance tuning tools for sure.

If you choose, you can verify syntax by ‚Äúparsing‚Äù in SSMS. However, this doesn‚Äôt compile. Compilation checks more than your syntax. It actually validates the objects referenced exist. The execution of statements in SQL Server has two phases: compilation and execution. This setting is useful for having SQL Server validate the syntax and object names in Transact-SQL code when executing. It is also useful for debugging statements that would generally be part of a larger batch of statements. MSDN #188394 I previously had done this basic verification by running an estimated execution plan. This had the benefit of finding compilation errors as well. However, with large batch jobs it could be problematic and slow, as it had to process and return all execution plans for the statements, which I didn‚Äôt need. Having this function can be a nice resource for validation of scripts before running, without the overhead of estimated execution plans. Additionally, you can handle transactional rollbacks and prevent cascading problems from happening when running a batch that changes your database by setting NOEXEC ON when encountering an error.

Due to requirements at the time, I needed the flexibility of the ‚ÄúMAIN‚Äù proc which generated a dynamic select statement, while overriding certain requested views by executing a stored proc instead of the dynamic sql. During this, I started looking into the string parsing being completed for a comma delimited list of numbers to lookup (the primary key). I figured I‚Äôd explore the benefits of the user defined table and pass through the list of ids from the .NET application with a table parameter instead of using comma delimited list. Some great material I came across indicated the overhead might be a little more client side, but that the benefits to cardinality estimation and providing SQL Server a table to work with can far outweigh the initial startup cost when dealing with lots of results to join against. The main area I wanted to address first, that I couldn‚Äôt find any clear documentation on was the memory footprint. I saw mention on various sources that a TVP can have a lower memory footprint in SQL Server‚Äôs execution due to the fact as intermediate storage it can be pointed at by reference, rather than creating a new copy each time, like when working with parsing into another variable using comma delimited lists. I get that passing the stored proc a table variable means it‚Äôs working with provided object, but what about the portability of this object? In my case, there are at least 2 levels being worked. The MAIN proc and the CHILD proc. The child proc needs access to the same list of ids. The dynamic statement in the MAIN proc also needs the list of ids. Currently it was creating the list of ids by inserting into a table parameter the delimited list of values. Could I instead consider passing the actual table parameter around since it‚Äôs by a readonly object and hopefully keep referring to it, instead of having separate copies being created each time. This could reduce the IO requirements and tempdb activity by having a single TVP being used by the MAIN and CHILD procs. Summarized IO: The footprint is reduced when dealing with IO from the child statement, because it keeps pointing to the same in memory object. I also validated this further by examining a more complex version of the same query that compares the comma delimited list against executing a nested stored procedure, which in turn has dynamic sql that needs the table parameter passed to it. The results of the review show successfully that it keeps pointing to the same temp object! In summary, the table valued parameter can end up being pretty powerful when dealing with passing a list of values that may need to be referenced by several actions or passed to nested procs (not that this is the best practice anyway). Disclaimer: this is working with the constraints of what I have to release soon, so not saying that nested procs with dynamic sql in both MAIN and CHILD are a great practice, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do!

This has improved my experience a little. - Also noted one major improvement that would help with tuning is aggregating the total IO, and stats, rather than only each individual statement. I‚Äôve found the need to compare two very different plans to see the total writes/reads variation and the impact on IO, but I‚Äôve having to utilize another tool for statistics IO parsing to run totals, and then come back to the SQL Sentry Plan explorer for other details.

That‚Äôs where I stood with XYPlorer for sometime. It is a developer‚Äôs tool first and foremost. It is complicated, but with this complication comes an extremely robust set of features. I honestly think that I‚Äôll never really know all of them, as this is more than just a swiss knife for file management. This is almost like stepping from a text editor for editing code to a full blown visual studio IDE. There is just that that much to learn! Over time, I‚Äôm finding myself less frustrated by using it, and more amazed at the tweaks here and there that can be found that can greatly enhance one‚Äôs file management and workflow, personal and professional. I won‚Äôt cover all features, but I think instead of doing a full blown review on the product, I‚Äôm going to add some incremental reviews on features as I discover, otherwise the vast feature-set will end up causing nothing but writer‚Äôs block and I‚Äôll never share anything (cause I‚Äôll be busy learning) Catalog Replaces Favorites with additional functionality The favorites section is one of my most used features in explorer. I setup the default locations I‚Äôm commonly navigating to, such as my SQL Query files location, cloud drives, temporary projects I‚Äôm working on, appdata folders I need access to occasionally, and more. XYPlorer Expands on this greatly by the concept of Catalogs. Instead of just having a shortcut, Catalogs allows one to expand the concept of shortcuts far beyond Windows Explorer (hereafter referred to as WE) and combines the favorites functionality with much more features. The Tree is an image of your computer‚Äôs file system. It shows you all what‚Äôs there. But, most of the time all is just too much‚Ä¶ The Catalog is the answer: here you can grow your own personal tree. Your favorite locations are deep down in some heavily nested structures? Lift them to the surface! Side by side with locations from the other end of your hard disk. You can navigate by the Catalog (finally a one-click favorite solution!) and you can drop onto the Catalog‚Äôs items. XYPlorer Help The catalog houses many categories. Each of these categories can provide various functionality beyond just linking to favorites. Here you can see applications listed directly. They provide functionality to open the app, open a file you drag onto it with the app (bypassing need to use ‚Äúopen with‚Äù dialogue) Opening the properties of a file allow one to futher edit the actions the application performs. ‚Ä¶. to be continued.

This was a suprise to me as all previous queries with optional parameters I‚Äôd used in the past seemed to use index seeks. I had to dig into this a little deeper to see if had been missing this in my past work and needed to find an alternative method for optional parameters. Original test procedure copied from original. The result from running the test1 procedure was to find a clustered index scan. SQL Server optimizer should be able to utilize the or conditions as long as an index covers the predicates, so I dug in deeper. When I ran a random query against a few tables I found this was creating table scans. Looking a little deeper I decided to evaluate the indexing on the tables to see if it was an issues with indexing, and not the pattern of using the OR against a variable. Test 1: SCANS - except with option recompile Found index scans on all my versions of running this except when including option(recompile) inside the stored procedure statement text. This of course fixed the issue by allowing sql to build the plan based on the exact value passed in, however, this would be at the cost of increasing CPU and negating the benefits of having a cached plan ready. Test 2: Ran exec sys.sp_updatestats Updating [dbo].[or_test] [PK__or_test__3213E83F7953A2B2], update is not necessary... [idx_or_test_col1], update is not necessary... [idx_or_test_col2], update is not necessary... [ix_nc_CoveringIndex], update is not necessary... 0 index(es)/statistic(s) have been updated, 4 did not require update. After researching for hours more, and reading many posts, I discovered I‚Äôve been missing this in previous work, probably due to query plan caching. When utilizing the variable from the stored procedure, the parameters are ‚Äúsniffed‚Äù. This means the plan is not rebuilt for each execution, but instead first execution is cached with the values it utilized. Thereafter, the optimizer can reuse this plan. The difference is that if you provide a value you manually plug into your test such as ‚Äúdeclare @Value = ‚ÄòFOO‚Äô \" then the optimizer has an actual value to use for each of your manually run executions. This means that if you have properly indexed the column, it would be sargable. However, the stored procedure is not passing in the actual value after the first run, it is trying to save the CPU demand the optimizer will need, and instead use the cached plan. This is likely the cause of my missing this in the past, as all my execution testing was based on commenting out the stored proc header and running manual tests. In this case, I‚Äôd correctly be seeing table seeks if indexed properly, because the optimizer was obtaining the actual values from my session. When executing the stored procedure externally, it looks to utilize parameter sniffing, which when working correctly is a good thing not a bug. However, when result sets can greatly vary, the problem of parameter sniffing can become a problem. In addition, if the OR statement is utilized as my original problem mentioned, the optimizer can decide that since parameter value is unknown at this time, that with an OR clause it would be better to run a table scan since all table results might be returned, rather than a seek. To bypass this, there are various approaches, but all are a compromise of some sort. The common approach to resolving if truly various selections may be made (in the case of SSRS reports for example) is to utilize option(recompile). This provide the actual value back to the compiler at run time, causing higher CPU usage, but also ensuring the usage of indexes and reducing scans when the columns are properly indexed. Again, this is one solution among several, which can include building dynamic query strings, logic blocks, and ot","date":"2014-12-11","objectID":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/or-pattern-causing-indexing-scans-in-parameter-based-queries/:0:0","series":null,"tags":["sql-server"],"title":"OR pattern causing indexing scans in parameter based queries","uri":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/or-pattern-causing-indexing-scans-in-parameter-based-queries/#"},{"categories":null,"content":"This is just a quick informational query to save as a snippet to get some quick information on running traces, and provide the stop and close snippet quickly if you want to stop a server side trace you created.

Quick hints on scope specific variables, syntax suggestions, function descriptions and more provide a valuable tool to productive coding.Coding in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has greatly improved over the version releases, but it still lags behind the power of Visual Studio‚Äôs intellisense, template insertions with ‚Äúfill in the blank‚Äù functionality . Additionally, the lack of automatic indentation means that lining up sub-queries and levels of logic can be annoyingly time consuming‚Ä¶ especially when not everyone on a team following the exact same coding standards. Legibility can easily suffer. Intellisense fails to properly update at times and reads pending statements as errors in syntax disabling the prompts from providing help. Automatic SQL formatting has been a long missed feature in SSMS. Trying to line up levels of nested queries can be very time consuming, and variances in the way people layout the query can effect readability. As a developer, I‚Äôm constantly looking for ways to improve my coding experience and streamline repetitive bits of coding. One such tool is SSMSBoost which provides many valuable shortcuts and features that SSMS omitted. The SSMSBoost team provides a free community edition to their fellow developers and responds to feedback promptly. I‚Äôd highly recommend checking them out. However, SSMS Intellisense improvement is by far the most powerful and productive coding tool that developers can look to improve.

For me, the best tool ended up being DbForge SQL Complete. The product fills in the gap on intellisense improvements. I‚Äôve installed in SSMS 2012, which is an improved environment and developers can use while still working with SQL Server 2008R2. ApexSQL Complete was offered free to the community with some powerful formatting capabilities. However, I was never able to get the formatting to truly match the clean results of Red Gate SQL Prompt and DbForge SQL Complete. Additionally, ApexSQL Complete had some lag issues originally which seem to have been improved in recent releases, but still seemed to get in the way more than the other tools. Their object info prompts were rudimentary and not formatted well. Red Gate SQL Prompt is a fine product, and rates highly. However, the customization offered in the formatting profiles was very limited and seemed focused on simplicity rather than offering complete control. It also seemed to have some unpolished edges, such as typing INSERT INTO TABLE, would provide the template of columns and value upon accepting the intellisense prompt, but the insertion didn‚Äôt follow the same formatting standards you had setup, and thus was harder to work with. It also was an expensive option compared to the others, with a Professional license running over $300+ for just a year of upgrades and support. DbForge SQL Complete offered the best solution for my needs. The amount of customization offered was incredible and the end result was a powerful formatting tool with amazing results, and a intellisense tool that truly improved my coding experience (enough that I wanted to share with others this tool!) This tool is also compatible with Visual Studio, so now those doing SQL work in Visual studio will have a great tool to help fill the deficiencies of VS for SQL development. Before reviewing the tool, I‚Äôd also mention that DBForge offers a user vote/forum with which I‚Äôve had feedback on almost every single issue right away. Their communication seems top notch, in additional to providing special programs and discounts for their products. One bug I found in the formatting was addressed with a new update within 2 weeks.

For users that want intellisense to help out only after a long pause and not constantly change while typing, this option is helpful. Setting a longer time on the ms will keep the box from showing up unless a command is pressed to initiate the intellisense showing up (Default: Control-Space).

I spent hours today working on figuring out why my simple date comparison in dynamic SQL wasn‚Äôt working.

Changing the look-up to ensure both dates were converted to date fixed the issue. During this debugging I was reviewing my dynamically created SQL statement. I learned that SSMS limits the amount of text it will return. In trying to view the single large UNION ALL statement, I was experiencing truncated results. I wanted to ensure the code being executed looked proper, but couldn‚Äôt get past the truncation. Enter SSMSBoost to the rescue! SSMSboost is created by developers and very responsive to requests.

I want to include TDD approach that abstracts the http server into a cmd file and allows me to mock http for tests. Use zerolog for logging with context. Key points I think it did well with: It structured it reasonably. It provided a jump start test file to do TDD with based on httptest. It was intelligent enough to add zerolog url handling logging using my preferred package. I could see how this could really help jump start intelligently templating out a project much better than just raw boilerplate. Instead of having to maintain cookie-cutter style templates, you might see the future allowing being very specific and generating customized code along with infra to support quicker iteration on development. Of course, everything should be vetted and scanned, but it‚Äôs a pretty incredible experience worth using copilot/chatGPT to occasionally accelerate development. ChatGPT‚Äôs answer: There are several good bootstrap templates available for Go REST API servers. One popular option is the Go kit template, which provides a clean architecture for building microservices in Go. Another option is the Gin Gonic template, which is a lightweight and fast HTTP web framework. For your specific requirements, I would recommend using the Gin Gonic template, which provides a simple and easy-to-use web framework. You can use the gin package to create an HTTP server and handle requests, and use the zerolog package to log requests and responses. Here‚Äôs an example of how you can structure your project using the Gin Gonic template and implement TDD: Start by creating a new project using the Gin Gonic template: go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin Create a new cmd directory in your project root and create a main.go file inside it: This file sets up a basic HTTP server using the api.NewServer function, which we‚Äôll define in the next step. It also initializes a logger using the logging.NewLogger function. Create a new api directory and create a server.go file inside it. This file defines a Server struct that holds a reference to our logger. We‚Äôll use this struct to handle HTTP requests in the ServeHTTP method. Now you can implement your TDD approach by writing tests and mocking the HTTP server using the httptest package: This test creates a new instance of our Server and mocks an HTTP request using the httptest package. It then calls the ServeHTTP method and checks that the response status code is 200 OK. Finally, you can use the zerolog package to log requests and responses in the ServeHTTP method. === ‚Äúcmd/main.go‚Äù ```go title=\"cmd/main.go\" package main import ( \"net/http\" \"os\" \"your_project/api\" \"your_project/logging\" ) func main() { logger := logging.NewLogger() defer logger.Sync() // Initialize the HTTP server server := api.NewServer(logger) // Start the server port := os.Getenv(\"PORT\") if port == \"\" { port = \"8080\" } logger.Info().Msgf(\"Starting server on port %s...\", port) if err := http.ListenAndServe(\":\"+port, server); err != nil { logger.Fatal().Err(err).Msg(\"Failed to start server\") } } ``` === ‚Äúapi/server.go‚Äù ```go title=\"api/server.go\" package api import ( \"net/http\" \"your_project/logging\" ) type Server struct { logger *logging.Logger } func NewServer(logger *logging.Logger) *Server { return \u0026Server{logger: logger} } func (s *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { // Handle the request } func (s *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { s.logger.Info().

If you are running inside Docker and need 127.0.0.1 to resolve to the host directly, then you‚Äôll need to handle that differently. See I want to connect from a container to a service on the host. I ran this problem through chatGPT and it provided a nice explanation.1 chatgpt answers: macOS and anonymous server for local testing The reason why you are seeing a pop-up alert on macOS when using http.ListenAndServe(\":\"+port, nil) is that when you use a port number without specifying an IP address, the Go HTTP server listens on all available network interfaces on the local machine, including the loopback address (127.0.0.1), which is used for communication within the same machine. When a process listens on a network interface, it is bound to that interface and can receive incoming connections from other machines on the network. In the case of the loopback interface, however, it can only receive connections originating from the same machine, and macOS security policies require user approval before allowing incoming connections to loopback addresses. When you specify an IP address like 127.0.0.1 explicitly, you are telling the server to only listen on that specific network interface, which macOS recognizes as a safe and expected behavior and does not generate an alert. To avoid the pop-up alert when using http.ListenAndServe(\":\"+port, nil), you can add your application to the list of trusted applications in the macOS Firewall settings, or use http.ListenAndServe(‚Äú127.0.0.1:\"+port, nil) to explicitly listen on the loopback interface. This is an incredible example of it jump-starting debugging efforts. The level of effort to get a quick answer was much faster than Google. While it may ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù, this is a good example of quick information that can help and let you move on.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/notes/development/go/http/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["api","rest","http"],"title":"HTTP","uri":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/notes/development/go/http/#anonymous-server"},{"categories":[],"content":"A reference for Kubernetes","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/notes/development/kubernetes/kubernetes/","series":null,"tags":["kubernetes"],"title":"kubernetes","uri":"https://www.sheldonhull.com/notes/development/kubernetes/kubernetes/"},{"categories":[],"content":" Deployment Tips What imagePullPolicy should I use?

You can get around needing Mage by creating Go files, but you‚Äôd have to add basic args handling for the main() entry point, and help generation. Mage tries to simplify the CLI invocation by auto-discovering all the matched functions in your magefiles directory and providing as tasks. Mage does not currently support flags, though this is actively being looked at. This means you are best served by keeping tasks very simple. For example, mage deploy project dev is about as complex as I‚Äôd recommend. Normally, you‚Äôd invoke with mytool -project ProjectName -env dev, and positions wouldn‚Äôt matter.

Linux as the primary OS for production, not Windows.1 How I Tend To Think Through Systems Someone might look at deploying a webservice and spin up an EC2 linux webserver and call it done. What would go through my head: Can I host this using a managed service such as ECS Fargate to avoid the operational toil of managing my own instance? Can I benefit from a service like this with autoscaling to ensure a failed task can automatically recover or allocate work to a new node? Did the web service add the instrumentation libraries for opentracing or the appropriate library? Are structured logs being used to ensure automatic parsing by the logging provider? Is the service being deployed via a CICD provider instead of manually? Are unit tests being run on developer machines with hooks and also by CI system? Are integration tests being run prior to deployment? Are service level objectives defined and tracked if required to ensure service isn‚Äôt over-engineered, but also allocated appropriate time for new work if problems occur that would impact customer satisfaction? Is the core infrastructure defined via code? Is the application configured to pull its configuration from environment variables or cloud configuration provider rather than requiring manual changes?
