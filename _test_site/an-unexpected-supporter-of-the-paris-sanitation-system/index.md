# An Unexpected Supporter of the Paris Sanitation System


Somtimes you feel that you&#39;ve done things right as a parent, even when things go awry.
There we were at the park, kids needing a restroom break.
Inside, I find no toilet paper, everything broken down, a poor public restroom experience.

Coming out, I see my family on the steps of this Parisian public edifice.
I comment on the bathroom&#39;s state.

{{&lt; conversation &gt;}}
Me: They were gross. No toilet paper.
Karis: Thankfully, mom gave me a baby wipe.
Me: You didn&#39;t try to flush it, right? They can clog the sewer system.
Karis: Oh no, I threw it in the trash, but first, it fell into the toilet water, and I had to fish it out.
Me: You did what?!
Karis: Yeah, I know about the sewer system, so I made sure to fish it out...with my hands. It was so gross.
{{&lt; /conversation &gt;}}

We all laughed. It&#39;s reassuring to know my daughter advocates for Paris&#39; sanitation system more than any tourist probably ever has.
After an extra amount of hand santizer, we moved on.
