# Log4 Brains Improves ADR Experience


I&#39;m a fan of architectural decision records.
Docs as code sets a practice for a team to track decisions in process and design.

[Log4Brains](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains) provides markdown template based adr creation, with an option to render a static site for reading.

If you want to start managing your ADRs in a structured way, but benefit from simple markdown as the source files, then this is a great option to consider.

It&#39;s really easy to get started with docker, no `npm install` required.

Just run: `docker run --rm -p 4004:4004 -v ${PWD}:/opt/adr trivadis/log4brains` and open `http://127.0.0.1:4004`
