Scope: The limit of this applies to all the technology, scripts, and other infrastructure of the site.
I've heavily leveraged others work to build this, so no limitations here!

## Code Snippets

Do whatever you want with it for work usage.
If I publish in repo, I'll address code there specifically with it's own license.
All snippets here feel free to use (at your own risk ðŸ˜„).
It would be really nice if you left my name in a comment somewhere with link to the webpage you got it from, but just a courtesy, not required.

This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can't change them in any way or use them commercially.
This applies to my blog articles, as quoting them is fine, but passing them off as your own is not kosher.
