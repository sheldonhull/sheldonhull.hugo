			<p>Dynamic SQL can be helpful, but a pain to debug. I spent hours today working on figuring out why my simple date comparison in dynamic SQL wasn&rsquo;t working. Found out that the remote database I was connecting to had a char date instead of a datetime. I found the comparison of CHARDATE &gt; VARCHARDATE failed to error out, but also failed to give a proper result set. Changing the look-up to ensure both dates were converted to date fixed the issue. During this debugging I was reviewing my dynamically created SQL statement.</p>

<p>I learned that SSMS limits the amount of text it will return. In trying to view the single large UNION ALL statement, I was experiencing truncated results. I wanted to ensure the code being executed looked proper, but couldn&rsquo;t get past the truncation.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="www.ssmsboost.com">SSMSBoost </a>to the rescue!</p>

<p>SSMSboost is created by developers and very responsive to requests. I&rsquo;ll do a proper review soon. They offer a visualize data option that goes beyond the usage I employed. For my purpose, I clicked on the cell and selected visual cell as text, and opened the data in notepad++. This showed the full text without truncation. I was able to move on in my debugging then as I knew the dynamic sql statement was not actually truncated except to my SSMS output. Dynamic SQL is a great tool, but if I had been working with direct queries, the issue would have been much faster to resolve!</p>
