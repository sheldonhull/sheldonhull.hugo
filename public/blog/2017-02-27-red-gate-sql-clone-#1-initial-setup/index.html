<p>Note this was during earlier beta usage, so some of the UI and other features will have been updated more. I plan on writing more on this promising tool as  I get a chance to dive into it more, especially the powershell cmdlets for database cloning automation. In the meantime, I believe the permissions issue is still relevant, so I&rsquo;ll post this as a reminder in case someone is working through the initial setup.</p>

<p>It seems like a real promising toolkit for testing and reducing storage requirements for testing database automated deployment pipelines.</p>

<h2 id="error-starting-service">Error starting service</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The Redgate SQL Clone service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t using for a while due to error message I couldn&rsquo;t figure out. I then read through the help documentation again and found that the permissions required for the service account should be a <strong>local admin</strong>. Once I added the service account to local admins, it correctly allowed the service to start.</p>
