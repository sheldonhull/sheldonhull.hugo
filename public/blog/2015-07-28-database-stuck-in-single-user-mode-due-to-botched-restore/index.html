		<h1>Database Stuck in Single-User Mode Due to Botched Restore</h1>
		<div class="content">
			

<p>Working in a development environment, I botched up a restore. After this restore attempt to overwrite my database with the previous version, I had it stuck in single-user mode.</p>

<p>SSMS provided me with helpful messages such as this:
<code>Changes to the state or options of database 'PoorDb' cannot be made at this time. The database is in single-user mode, and a user is currently connected to it.</code>
Additionally, I was told I was the deadlock victim when attempting to set the user mode back to multi-user.</p>

<p>Going forward I looked at several articles from Stack Overflow and various other blogs, and followed the recommended steps such as</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/97c73c8ef61c84e6adbb.js"></script>


<p>I even added a step to kill the connections to it by using this statement, helpfully posted by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7197574/script-to-kill-all-connections-to-a-database-more-than-restricted-user-rollback">Matthew Haugen</a></p>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/252ca75b8e8ab4fe64fa.js"></script>

 Finally went through and removed all my connections from master based on an additional post. No luck. Stopped my monitoring tools, no luck. At this point, it felt like a Monday for sure.</p>

<p>Since I was working in a development environment, I went all gung ho and killed every session with my login name, as there seemed to be quite a few , except for the spid executing. Apparently, the blocking process was executing from master, probably the incomplete restore that didn&rsquo;t successfully rollback. I&rsquo;ll have to improve my transaction handling on this, as I just ran it straight with no error checks.</p>

<p>What a waste of time, but at least I know to watch out next time, ensure my actions are checked for error and rolled back.
I&rsquo;m going to just blame it on the darn SSMS GUI. Seems like a convenient scapegoat this time.</p>

<p>Successful pushed out my changes with the following script:
