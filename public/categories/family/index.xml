      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made it my personal quest as a creative who has a passion for videography to try and capture simple moments during my life with family. There are plenty of epic indie films, and I can&amp;rsquo;t commit this type of time with a day job, family, and other interests. I think this is a good start.

      <description>This last Easter I had some fun with the kids at their grandparents. Remember the days of spinning until you were nauseous? Was fun to watch the kids enjoying this so I took a few clips, nothing fancy, just a snapshot of enjoying the little moments in life.
Thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll try this approach for a while. Small 2 minute videos that aren&amp;rsquo;t refined a lot are easy for me to produce.</description>
