      <description>Some effort I spent in researching Type Binding in Stack Overflow to help answer a question by Chris Oldwood helped me solidify my understanding of the best way to debug more complicated scenarios such as this in PowerShell.
 Why does this PowerShell function&amp;rsquo;s default argument change value based on the use of . or &amp;amp; to invoke a command within it? 
 Spent some digging into this and this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve observed.</description>

      <description>Last Minute Migration? If you are about to perform a last minute migration here&amp;rsquo;s a couple tips as you jump ship from Hipchat and move to Slack. Hipchat is sunsetting I believe on Feb 15th, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d share what I do have in case it&amp;rsquo;s helpful, as it won&amp;rsquo;t stay tremendously relevant for long.
Problem: Hipchat access will be removed and you need more time Export the hipchat content to a file and upload to your own s3 bucket.</description>

      <description>Wanted to be proactive and move a database that was in the default path on C:\ to a secondary drive as it was growing pretty heavily.
What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize was the adventure that would ensure.
Lesson 1 Don&amp;rsquo;t move a SQL Server database to a volume that someone has set NTFS Compression on at the drive level.
Lesson 2 Copy the database next time, instead of moving. Would have eased my anxious dba mind since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a backup.</description>

      <description>It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this hard. This is a consumate #windowsmoment
If you occasionally use something like Robocopy, or other command line tool, it can be possible to create a directory with a trailing slash. For instance
robocopy &amp;#34;C:\test\Taco&amp;#34; &amp;#34;C:\Burritos\are\delicious &amp;#34; This trailing space would be actually used by Robocopy to initialize a directory that has a trailing space in the name. This can appear as a duplicator in explorer, until you try to rename and notice a trailing slash.</description>

      <description>SqlServer Powershell Cmdlets 2017 - Initialize Look Diving into the Sql Server Management Objects library can be a pretty interesting process. You get to work with database objects as in a new way, and begin manipulating and execute code in a much different approach than purely using T-SQL. Powershell offers a unique way to interact with prebuilt cmdlets, and you can explore leveraging .NET in powershell as well to have a powerful toolkit of options.</description>

Once downloaded, generate a new config file by running the first command and then the next to install as service.</description>

      <description>There are a few .NET tools that until recently I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to work with as much, specifically ANTS Memory Profiler and ANTS Performance Profiler. The memory profiler is more useful for someone focused on memory leaks which a SQL Dev isn&amp;rsquo;t as focused on for performance tuning. However, there are major benefits for diving into SQL Performance tuning with ANTS Performance profiler. I think I&amp;rsquo;d say this tool makes the epic category of my #cooltools kit and will be added to my COOL TOOLS page here for SQL performance tuning.</description>

      <description>Update &amp;ldquo;Updated: 2018-03-29&amp;rdquo; Use Chocolatey. This page keeps changing it&amp;rsquo;s structure, so the regex to parse for Ketarin and this PS1 script keep breaking. Updated to latest version as of 2018-03-29, but recommend checking out the Chocolately Package created for SSMS for this by flcdrg as chocolately is a much nicer way to keep up to date and more likely long-term to succeed than my gist :-) To use chocolatey (after setup), you only have to use choco upgrade sql-server-management-studio which is much easier to remember than using this gist.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve run into the case where I wanted updates continually applied, while the machine still was part of the GPO that didn&amp;rsquo;t automatically install updates. For this developer and test oriented machine I wanted every update applied.
I utilized a great module for this and created a script to setup the task and logging to make this an easy task.
If you experience an issue with the WindowsUpdate Vs Microsoft update as the configured update provider, then you can just change the switch in the script for -MicrosoftUpdate to -WindowsUpdate</description>

      <description>Apparently, boolean values for custom VSTS tasks for versions prior to TFS 2015 Update 3) require some special handling as they don&amp;rsquo;t pass the checkbox values as actual powershell $true or $false. Instead the task passes this information along as true or false. To properly handle this you&amp;rsquo;ll need to pass in the value as a string then convert to boolean.
I found a great start on working on this solution in a blog post by Rene which has more detail, so check it out.</description>

      <description>Running tasks in parallel can be a bit difficult in powershell. However, there are a few projects out there that optimize the performance and provide a better experience of running tasks in parallel with less effort.#cool uses A few cool uses of this might be running parallel sql queries across multiple servers or databases while maintaining a throttled limit to avoid saturation of the target environment. Additionally, long running queries might benefit in running in parallel if running on multiple objects in the same database or in different databases.</description>

Some dlls with invalid assembly header information were found, and this skips those as warnings.</description>

In the meantime, if you are looking for a quick way to leverage some parallel query running, take a look at PSParallel. I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided Powershell Jobs/Workflow due to limitations they have and the performance penalty I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is associated with them.</description>

      <description>info &amp;ldquo;Updated 2017-01-25&amp;rdquo; While I think the minionware solution is pretty awesome, I think it takes more work for the value, and can be a bit confusing to correctly setup, vs the Ola Hallengren solution, esp since you can install this quickly with dbatools now. I&amp;rsquo;d lean towards Ola Hallengren for simple implementations, and consider MinionWare&amp;rsquo;s option if you are looking at the their flexibility in the table based configuration.</description>
