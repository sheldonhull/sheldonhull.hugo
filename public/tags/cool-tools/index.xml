      <description>info &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; - GitKraken - Source Tree - Posh-Git - Cmder
 Git Some Pain Having come from a Team Foundation Server background, I found Git to be a bit confusing. The problem is primarily the big difference in a distributed version control system vs non-distributed. In addition to that complexity the terminology is not exactly intuitive. A lot of phrases like PULL have different results depending on what step you are in.</description>

For using telegraf, I&amp;rsquo;d honestly recommend just leveraging the compiled binary provided.
Once downloaded, generate a new config file by running the first command and then the next to install as service.</description>

Since their product is continually improving, I&amp;rsquo;m going to just link to their product here instead so you can review their latest demo content there. Dataedo. Overall, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the product and think it has been improved over time. There are SQL scripts for bulk updating certain values on their website that can help improve building a project for an existing database as well.</description>

      <description>There are a few .NET tools that until recently I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to work with as much, specifically ANTS Memory Profiler and ANTS Performance Profiler. The memory profiler is more useful for someone focused on memory leaks which a SQL Dev isn&amp;rsquo;t as focused on for performance tuning. However, there are major benefits for diving into SQL Performance tuning with ANTS Performance profiler. I think I&amp;rsquo;d say this tool makes the epic category of my #cooltools kit and will be added to my COOL TOOLS page here for SQL performance tuning.</description>

      <description>Update &amp;ldquo;Updated: 2018-03-29&amp;rdquo; Use Chocolatey. This page keeps changing it&amp;rsquo;s structure, so the regex to parse for Ketarin and this PS1 script keep breaking. Updated to latest version as of 2018-03-29, but recommend checking out the Chocolately Package created for SSMS for this by flcdrg as chocolately is a much nicer way to keep up to date and more likely long-term to succeed than my gist :-) To use chocolatey (after setup), you only have to use choco upgrade sql-server-management-studio which is much easier to remember than using this gist.</description>

      <description>Previous Related Post: Split personality text editing in SSMS with Sublime Text 3
In this prior post I wrote about how to call Sublime Text 3 from SSMS to allow improved text manipulation to be quickly called from an active query window in SQL Management Studio. Vscode is a newer editor from Microsoft, and the argument calls took a little work to get working. Here is what I found for having your SQL file open in vscode via call from SSMS (I imagine also works in Visual Studio 2017 this way as well).</description>

      <description>Other Posts in Series  Running InfluxDb As A Service in Windows Setting Up InfluxDb, Chronograf, and Grafana for the SqlServer Dev InfluxDB And Annotations Capturing Perfmon Counters With Telegraf  There are some beautiful ways to visualize time series data with the tools I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over. This post is purely focused on the initial setup and saving you some time there. In a future post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how some of these tools can help you visualize your server performance in a powerful way, including taking metrics from multiple types of servers that be working with SQL Server, and combining the metrics when appropriate to give a full picture of performance.</description>

      <description>Tracking time is always a beast. With the amount of context switching many developers do, it can be tough to remember how much time went to each project. With companies looking to track effort on sprints, hours on a client project, or (as in my case) just a dev wanting to better evaluate the productive use of time, this app fills some gaps that others don&amp;rsquo;t.For instance, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried tools such as Toggl, and similar.</description>

      <description>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen much talk on doing data comparisons on temporal tables, as they are a new feature. I went through the exercise to compare current to historical to see how Red Gate &amp;amp; Devart handled this. I&amp;rsquo;m a part of the Friends of Red Gate program, so love checking out their latest updates, and I&amp;rsquo;m also a regular tester on Devart which also provides fantastic tools. Both handled Temporal Tables with aplomb, so here&amp;rsquo;s a quick walk through on how I did this.</description>

      <description>Ads&amp;hellip;I know they employ people, make the world go round, gave us google&amp;hellip;. but seriously I hate almost all ads. If my ranking in google search drops to the end because of this post&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip;. I&amp;rsquo;m ok with that.
Adguard I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this for over a year as a beta tester (they provided license for me to test and use latest versions). I had a perfect case to demo the craziness of some sites with ads vs using Adguard the other day and figured I&amp;rsquo;d share it if you&amp;hellip; like me&amp;hellip; hate the clutter they provide on many sites.</description>

      <description>Creating tracks at home can be very intensive in time, so I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a better way to bring a larger sound to a track with less effort. One of the big gaps for me has been the drum parts. I&amp;rsquo;ve evaluated a few options, and finally dived into BFD3 for this latest project that is a post-rock style track. This was my first time diving into BFD3 for a full song, so I had a bit to learn.</description>

      <description>I had some cross database comparisons that I wanted to simplify, but ensuring the collation matched. The amount of objects that I would have had to drop and recreate was a bit daunting, so I looked for a way to migrate the database to a different collation.Using the Red Gate toolkit, I was able to achieve this pretty quickly. There are other methods with copying data built in to SSMS that could do some of these steps, but the seamless approach was really nice with the SQL Toolbelt.</description>

      <description>Syncovery &amp;amp; Arq 5I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a lot of file sync/backup utilities. The primary definition to get right is that there are two main functions people try to achieve with this type of software.
 File Syncing: Syncing Files Between Cloud and Local File Backup: Preserving Files, sometimes with versioning, in order to protect against loss. These two approaches require a diffferent solution many times, as focusing on file syncing means you are more at risk, as handing conflicting sync scenarios might cause loss.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a geek, software nerd, and a musician. As I&amp;rsquo;ve been stagnating lately in my musical progression I decided to dive into trying to produce some recordings of some of my music, hoping to spice up the old brain.I have a lot to learn. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty humbling, but despite being a musician and a developer with some decent tinkering ability, I&amp;rsquo;ve found getting into recording and production a bit challenging on certain things.</description>

      <description>Had a chance to look at this program thanks to the generosity of the developer. They had a promotion that ended prematurely and they sent me a license as a goodwill gesture. Pretty fantastic service, and thanks to them for this.The documentation was a little sparse for the Windows setup, so I ran into some complications getting it to work.
I have used TouchOSC, and had some difficulty with configuring it for windows.</description>

      <description>Remote server management is a fact of life for folks involved with sql server. Since we work so often with remote machines I looked into a few tools that provided a better workflow than the default Microsoft tools. This one came out as the winner by far.
A better remote desktop manager First off, if you are using RDC&amp;hellip;. why? At least move up to RDCMan, a microsoft tool that allows for much quick context switching between machines, inherited password settings for a group of servers, and more.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t explored the visual color coding of tabs based on pattern matches with SQL Prompt, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest you check this out. Earlier iterations of Red Gate&amp;rsquo;s SQL Prompt did not change tab color immediately when the connection was changed. Red Gate&amp;rsquo;s tab color could get out of sync occasionally, so I stopped depending on it.
Apparently this has been improved on and my testing now shows that the tab recoloring for connections is changing when the connection is updated immediately.</description>

      <description>In the context of my developer machine, I had log files I wanted to parse through. I setup a log library to output the results on a test server to a sql table instead of text files. However, this meant that my &amp;ldquo;log viewers&amp;rdquo; that handled regex parsing weren&amp;rsquo;t in the picture at this point. I wanted to parse out some columns from a section of message text, and thought about CLR as a possible tool to help this.</description>

      <description>Giveaway details at the bottom for those interestedDealing with development &amp;amp; sql servers, I like to know what type of network traffic is happening on my machine. What is the overhead of monitoring on network bandwidth, what is communicating across servers or even externally?
What is phoning home? You can create perfmon counters, but realistically sometimes I just want a easy quick overview of network traffic with minimal overhead. I have been using a utility I came across called Glasswire, and found this tremendously helpful.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had this tool around for a while, but never found much usage out of it to be honest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up writing a review as I had other tools that did text replacements, and history/session saving. I&amp;rsquo;ve always considered this tools implementation of SQL History/Tabs saver the best period, even over Red Gate Tab History, SSMSBoost, etc. However, recommending the tool solely based on it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic history saver wasn&amp;rsquo;t really something I was going to do.</description>

      <description>comparing instances When working with a variety of instances, you can often deal with variances in configuration that might impact the performance. Without digging into each instance you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know immediately that this had happened. There are fantastic tools, like Brent Ozar&amp;rsquo;s SP_Blitz, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t focus on every single configuration value and cross instance comparison. To supplement great material like that a tool like OmniCompare is great.
side by side comparison I am definitely adding to my list of great sql tools.</description>

However, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the needed to try and deploy a database project from visual studio automatically, and this is my process through it.
There are benefits for those who don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to run this against production, but instead for those who want to continually deploy check-ins and run tests, documentation, or other tasks against the deployed schema.</description>

      <description>data structures are art If anyone thinks that working with complex data structures is boring&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know what world they live in. The problem is often that sql tables and data structures are just script files and lists of tables in an object explorer.  However, once you crack open the visual aspect of database diagramming and data architecture, you can see some interesting patterns emerge.

      <description>info &amp;ldquo;update 2016-04-27 11:20 - Red Gate SQL Toolkit&amp;rdquo; This also is a great help for folks using Red Gate SQL Toolkits. It can help ensure all items are up to date.

      <description>Diff all files  info &amp;ldquo;Updated: 2017-07-14&amp;rdquo; Still find this incredibly awesome! Developer just updated for Visual Studio 2017 after a lot of hard work. Github repo here for any issues. Big thanks to DeadlyDog for this great tool and putting in the effort to update for VS2017. deadlydog/VS.DiffAllFiles: Visual Studio Extension to make comparing files before and after committing them to Git and TFS faster and easier
info &amp;ldquo;Updated: 2016-01-25&amp;rdquo; I started using the option to compare a single file at a time, since it picks up the syntax highlighting then.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited. I know you love documentation, and just can&amp;rsquo;t wait to spend some time digging in to document your database thoroughly. I imagine you probably want to build visio charts manually, or draw whiteboard diagrams by hand and take pictures.
For the rest of us that are lazy, a tool to help document your database is a great idea. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of SQL Doc by Red Gate, and ApexSQL Doc .</description>

      <description>info &amp;ldquo;Updated: 2016-04-08&amp;rdquo; Been working through some issues with Clarify app on my personal computer, something I messed up. @trevordevore with @clarifyapp has worked step by step through it with me providing some great personal assistance. In addition, he&amp;rsquo;s given me some tips about my research in merging in a php script to automatically upload my images to cloudinary for hosting. I just finished producing some documentation with Clarify 2, and I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best tools I can think of for producing a stellar documentation without requiring the user to spend time doing much formatting.</description>

      <description>My preview post showed a demonstration of the multi-cursor editing power of Sublime Text 3 when speeding up your coding with SQL server.There is a pretty straight forward way to setup sublime (or one of your preferred text editors) to open the same file you are editing in SQL Management Studio without much hassle. I find this helpful when the type of editing might benefit from some of the fantastic functionality in Sublime.</description>

      <description>Red Gate Documentation Update Looks like the rapid release channel now has a great feature for locking database objects that you are working on. Having worked in a shared environment before, this could have been a major help. It&amp;rsquo;s like the poor man&amp;rsquo;s version of checking an object out in visual studio except on database objects! With multiple developers working in a shared environment, this might help reduce conflicting multiple changes on the same object.</description>

      <description>There are probably a common number of apps you pull up when you pull up your system. For example, I pull up my Trello board, outlook, XYplorer, Sublime text 3, Sql server management studio, and ketarin (app updater). Found that you can easily setup a simply alias and launch a group of apps or files at anytime by simply typing the keyword.
This could easily launch a favorite group of files by adding to your startup or project list as you go.</description>

      <description>currently on version 14.60 I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of finding tools that help automate and streamline things that should are routine actions.Surprisingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it incredibly challenging to move away from the default Windows Explorer for file management, as the familiarity it offers makes it somewhat tough to be patient with learning an alternative, especially if the alternative offers more complication. That&amp;rsquo;s where I stood with XYPlorer for sometime. It is a developer&amp;rsquo;s tool first and foremost.</description>

      <description>When dealing with large amounts of objects in a database, navigation can be tedious with SSMS object explorer. This extender organizes the objects into groups based on schema, helping a developer easily navigate to the appropriate object. The current version didn&amp;rsquo;t work for views, but the other objects were grouped effectively. Highly recommend!

      <description>For sake of future generations, let&amp;rsquo;s begin to reduce typing and reuse code we&amp;rsquo;ve built. I think we can all agree that TSQL statements are often repeated. Ideally, snippets should be created to reduce repeated typing and let us focus on logic and content. However, some statements may not really be &amp;ldquo;snippet worthy&amp;rdquo;, and just be quick adhoc queries. In the past, the solution for saving queries for reuse or reference in the future would be to just save in the projects folder manually.</description>

      <description>Intellisense can be a boon to adding quick development. Quick hints on scope specific variables, syntax suggestions, function descriptions and more provide a valuable tool to productive coding.Coding in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has greatly improved over the version releases, but it still lags behind the power of Visual Studio&amp;rsquo;s intellisense, template insertions with &amp;ldquo;fill in the blank&amp;rdquo; functionality .
Additionally, the lack of automatic indentation means that lining up sub-queries and levels of logic can be annoyingly time consuming&amp;hellip; especially when not everyone on a team following the exact same coding standards.</description>
