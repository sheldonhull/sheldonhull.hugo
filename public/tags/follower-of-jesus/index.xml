      <description>This last Easter I had some fun with the kids at their grandparents. Remember the days of spinning until you were nauseous? Was fun to watch the kids enjoying this so I took a few clips, nothing fancy, just a snapshot of enjoying the little moments in life.
Thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll try this approach for a while. Small 2 minute videos that aren&amp;rsquo;t refined a lot are easy for me to produce.</description>

      <description>Proud to announce Ella the newest addition to my family joined us today @ 6:19pm, weighing in at 6lbs and 11 ounces. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s 6lbs of cuteness. :-) I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly blessed to have this third addition to my family, and look forward to treasuring every moment with her. God sure knows how to give an amazing gift!
It was a rough 24 hours resulting in our first cesarean experience. This was a bit intense, but Sarah pulled through as a trooper, and we are now finished with post-operation recovery, and enjoying time with our new bundle of awesome.</description>

      <title>Recovery is a Marathon, Not a Sprint - Hurricane Harvey</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the road to recovery is not an instant process. Right now we have a ton of volunteers and people working to help those in need. I&amp;rsquo;m reminding myself, as much as any readers here, the process to recovery for people most impacted is not a single week of effort event. In some cases, entire homes were lost and without flood insurance, the financial devastation can be profound.</description>

      <description>Waterlogged What a crazy weekend. Choose to evacuate the family as water was slowly creeping up closer to the house. I was ready today when I made it back to the house to see the water in the house, but to my astonishment it was only half-way up the driveway. Turning down the road 1 house away, many houses did not fare so well, and water looks to have made it in many homes.</description>

      <title>Lack for Nothing</title>

      <description>The message of this song is one that that has been driving itself home as more and more important to me. We are not viewed in our frailty as we come before God to worship Him. We are not judged and condemned. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t look and tell us to come back when we are in a better place. Instead, just as the author of Hebrews writes (Heb 10), we can come with bold confidence, knowing that the way has been made for us in Christ, with us being viewed through the &amp;ldquo;curtain&amp;rdquo; of Christ.</description>
