      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the road to recovery is not an instant process. Right now we have a ton of volunteers and people working to help those in need. I&amp;rsquo;m reminding myself, as much as any readers here, the process to recovery for people most impacted is not a single week of effort event. In some cases, entire homes were lost and without flood insurance, the financial devastation can be profound.</description>

      <description>info &amp;ldquo;Updated: 2017-08 1:30pm Wednesday&amp;rdquo; Better than expected, we are looking to be back in our house Thursday. Apparently some SUV&amp;rsquo;s are just starting to gain access. Don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk it so giving it a little extra time. That&amp;rsquo;s much better than I expected at beginning of this whole situation! Relief efforts mentioned at bottom are underway at nwvineyard.com so if you are looking to help the Tomball/Northwest Houston area that&amp;rsquo;s one place to help or find out how to help.</description>
